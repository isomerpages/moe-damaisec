<p>Teachers’ Day was a week-long celebration this year to celebrate the hard
work of our educators and support staff. Students and staff wrote affirmation
cards to teachers to express their gratitude and staff received goodies,
namely, an ice-cream treat by the PSG and a customised tiffin carrier.
On 29 August 2024, we celebrated Teachers' Day with the theme <em>Damai's Shining Stars</em>.
The day was a heartwarming tribute to the teachers who had guided and inspired
students throughout the year.</p>
<p>The event kicked off with rousing cheers as the teachers entered the hall
like stars in our <em>Walk of Fame</em> segment where they were greeted by
the Leaders Council and presented with flower bouquets as a token of appreciation.
The celebration continued with energetic performances, including a dance
by Sufi, Nadine, Kai Xin and Syafiqah from 403, and a solo rap by Yue Xiang
from 302. Miss Evangeline Lim and Miss Wirda also took the stage for an
exciting duet performance.</p>
<p>A key highlight was the Teachers’ Day Award Ceremony, which celebrated
the unique contributions of the teaching staff. Teachers were honoured
with fun and meaningful awards such as the <em>Tech Guru Award</em>, <em>Energiser Bunny Award, Most Gen-Z Teacher</em> and <em>Heart of Gold Award</em>,
sparking cheers from the audience. Each teacher’s recognition was a testament
to their dedication and the positive impact they had on the students.</p>
<p>The grand finale of the event was a surprise flashmob. The finale saw
both the Leaders’ Council and some teachers dancing to the song, <em>Shake It Off</em>,
creating a joyful and celebratory atmosphere. Teachers and students then
continued the celebration with class parties where fun games, karaoke and
dance activities await in class. The Leaders’ Council also presented floral
gifts to the non-teaching staff, recognising their essential role in supporting
the school community.</p>
<p>All Damai staff then adjourned for an exciting and sumptuous lunch buffet
at the Concorde Hotel. Embracing the theme "<em>Blast From The Past</em>,"
staff excitedly arrived dressed in a variety of creative outfits that flashed
back to yesteryears. Staff came in their Old Shanghai-inspired looks, vibrant
retro fashion and even as Kopitiam uncles among others. &nbsp;The event
was truly a blast, with everyone participating in lively games and group
activities that filled the room with laughter and smiles.</p>
<p>Teachers' Day 2024 was a memorable and joyous occasion that truly highlighted
the shining stars of Damai Secondary School — the dedicated and hardworking
teachers and supporting staff.</p>
