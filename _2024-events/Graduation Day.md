<p>On 26 September 2024, we celebrated the wonderful graduating cohort of
Secondary 4 and 5 students. The afternoon was filled with joy, laughter
and a sense of nostalgia as we walked down memory lane to revisit some
of the key highlights of their school life.</p>
<p>With the theme, <em>Reach for the Stars</em>, the heartfelt and lively
celebration started with a rousing entrance by each graduating class into
the school hall. Our leaders councillors transformed the school hall into
a beautiful star-studded soiree, creating an unforgettable afternoon for
the Class of 2024. The celebration kicked off with an inspiring message
by Ms Chan, our principal, as she challenged the graduands to embrace their
future and live out the Damaian values in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>Each classâ€™ Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) then led in heart-warming class
tributes to their form and subject teachers who have guided them on their
academic journey. They also shared words of encouragement to their fellow
classmates. Through their heartfelt words, the PSLs not only acknowledged
the pivotal role of their form teachers but also, reaffirmed their hard
and heart work. Their tributes were a testament to the care and compassion
of Damai teachers and a reminder of the friendships forged within the class.</p>
<p>To encourage our graduands for their national exams and motivate them
to give their best in the last lap, the Sec 3 classes presented their seniors
with heartfelt messages of encouragement. The graduands also received a
keepsake luggage tag with the emblem of the school T-shirt as a token to
remember their pivotal time in the school.</p>
<p>As the curtains closed on the Graduation Day celebrations, graduands were
left with a final message from the year head, Mrs Jackie Chan, reminding
them to always embrace the little things in life, beyond books and grades.
The students then tucked into a sumptuous lunch and snapped numerous photos
to take away with them as lasting memories. With lots of laughter and some
tears, students wrapped up the event by writing well wishes and parting
words on one another's T shirts, signifying the indelible marks they have
left on one another.</p>
<p>Class of 2024, we wish you the very best. Reach for the stars and continue
to grow with purpose and meaning beyond Damai.</p>
