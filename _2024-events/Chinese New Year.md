<p>This year, we celebrated the Year of the Dragon with a series of vibrant
events. We began with a class activity aimed at immersing students in Chinese
culture, where they crafted traditional Chinese quill fans. Following that
engaging activity, students gathered for a mini class party, delighting
in the sharing of Chinese traditional snacks as they fostered camaraderie.</p>
<p>After the bonding activity, students enjoyed a captivating concert, hosted
by our three emcees: Snitikha, Ting Xuan, and Shannon. Each performing
arts group, consisting of Modern Dance, Ethnic Dance, Guzheng Ensemble,
Drama Club, Choir and Band, delivered exceptional performances, captivating
the audience with their talents and dedication.</p>
<p>Adding to the festive ambience, our two vice-principals adorned themselves
as fortune gods, spreading joy and prosperity among all present. The climax
of the concert was marked by electrifying lion and dragon dance performances,
elevating the atmosphere to new heights of excitement and celebration.</p>
