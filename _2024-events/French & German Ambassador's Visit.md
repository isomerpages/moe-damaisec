<p><strong>16 July 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Damai Secondary School hosted the German and French Ambassadors for an
intimate dialogue session on 16 July 2024. The dialogue session was organised
as part of the EU@Schools programme to provide students with the opportunities
to learn more about the European Union and its relations with Singapore.
Through the dialogue session, the students grew in their 21st Century Competencies&nbsp;by
developing global awareness and appreciating different cultures and languages
via an introduction to the rich and diverse cultures of Europe.</p>
<p>The EU Dialogue kicked off on an energetic note with a trivia quiz that
had even the Ambassadors thinking deeply on the questions. The students
were abuzz with questions during the Fireside Chat as the Ambassadors took
turns sharing their experience and thoughts. The Dialogue also provided
a unique opportunity for students and teachers to gain key insights into
what it takes to drive sustainability initiatives, the key roles, impacts
and challenges in the European Union, and how it is working to promote
a more sustainable world with Asian counterparts such as Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, the students were mesmerised by the heartfelt, humorous
and candid sharing by the Ambassadors on their lives as diplomats and what
it takes to pursue a career in the Foreign Service. The students left the
session excited about European history, culture and eager to know more
about the work of diplomats.</p>
