<p>The 5th Student Leaders&rsquo; Investiture was held over two mornings, on 18 and 19 April this year. On 18 April 2022, the Student Councillors were invested during the morning assembly in the hall. Our Principal, Ms Chan, presented the Student Councillors with collar pins and certificates of appointment. It was the first time after two years (due to the Covid-19 pandemic) that an in-person investiture was conducted. The Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) were also formally recognised during the session as well. The PSLs were presented with collar pins by their Form Teachers (FTs) during the morning FT time on 19 April. This investiture served as a significant milestone occasion for the Student Leaders in Damai Secondary School as they grow in their journey to Aspire, Explore, Achieve!</p>
