<p>On 30 September 2022 and 7 October 2022, we bid adieu to our graduating Secondary 4 and 5 students. The intimate and heartwarming Graduation Day marked the culmination of our graduating students&rsquo; years of hard work and memorable time spent at Damai Secondary. The students ended their last day at Damai Secondary with class-based celebrations commemorating their successes and achievements during their graduating year, video highlights of their time together as a class and showing appreciation and receiving encouragement from their classmates and teachers. The Peer Support Leaders rose to the occasion marvellously to lead and deliver their appreciation speech to the teachers with admirable confidence. The students then, tucked into a sumptuous lunch as they laughed, joked, and snapped numerous photo memories for a lifetime. With lots of laughter and some tears, students wrapped up the event by writing well wishes and parting words on one another&rsquo;s T shirt, signifying the indelible marks they have left on each other&rsquo;s secondary school life.</p>
<p>Experiencing the pandemic for most of their secondary school years had undoubtedly brought many disruptions to their lives. Despite these challenges, our graduands exhibited resilience, tenacity, and adaptability. We are proud that you have grown in your four years at Damai and it is our dearest hope that you will never lose your zest for life. As you move on to your next milestones in life, we wish you the very best and always reach for your dreams!</p>
