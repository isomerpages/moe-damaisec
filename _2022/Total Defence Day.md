<p>We commemorated Total Defence Day with class-based activities to learn about Singapore&rsquo;s six pillars of Total Defence.&nbsp; The Peer Support Leaders conducted our annual TDD Quiz via Kahoot and we then embarked on different commemorative activities to reinforce the learning about military, economic, civil, psychological, social and digital defence.</p>
