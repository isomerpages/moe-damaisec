<p>The National Day 2022's theme &ldquo;Stronger Together, Majulah!&rdquo; was a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as a united and strong people towards a better future. Arising from struggles in living with the COVID-19 pandemic, &ldquo;Stronger Together&rdquo; reminds Singaporeans that unity in our diversity is what makes us stronger. To celebrate the lifting of SMMs, we decided to take a community heritage walk to commemorate National Day 2022 this year.</p>
<p>Damai Secondary School breathed life into &ldquo;Majulah!&rdquo; (onward) as the school explored the nation&rsquo;s Civic District on 8 August 2022 to celebrate National Day 2022. Starting from 24 different start points, each class navigated their own way through various historical monuments and heritage corners around central Singapore to learn about Singapore&rsquo;s history and journey as a nation. Using their PDLs, the students learnt more about each site and answered quizzes. This self-guided walk culminated in a mass school gathering at Gardens by the Bay&rsquo;s Silver Garden for the grand finale celebrations. Amidst the grandeur of the Super Trees and with the magnificent Marina Bay skyline in the background, we sang our hearts out and renewed our commitment to truly be &ldquo;Stronger Together, Majulah!&rdquo;</p>
