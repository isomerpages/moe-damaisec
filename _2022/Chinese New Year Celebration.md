<p>We ushered in the Year of the Tiger with celebrations in the classroom as well as a class potluck session! Our students, of all ethnicities and cultural affiliations, were fully immersed in the celebrations as they feasted on Chinese New Year goodies and drinks.</p>
<p>The Mother Tongue department organised the festivities and put together a virtual concert for students to enjoy in class. Ho Yue Ling (401) was the eloquent emcee who impressed everyone with her bilingual fluency. Lim Zhong Ping (301) performed two melodic solo pieces on the Guzheng while Nicole Sim (202) serenaded us with some catchy festive songs.</p>
<p>Lastly, Elise Seah (403) and Belle (404) brought festive cheer with their graceful and energising dance performance.</p>
<p>The highlight of the celebrations was the surprise visit by the God of Fortune to every class, as all students, teachers and staff were presented with goodies as a symbolic wish for a prosperous and sweet new year. Everyone was pleasantly surprised to realise that the God of Fortune was none other than our Vice-Principal, Mr Sivakumar. The fantastic celebrations brought much joy to the staff and students as they cheered for a happy and healthy Year of the Tiger.</p>
