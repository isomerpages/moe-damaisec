<p>The school celebrated Hari Raya Puasa on 13 May 2022, with a special assembly. The vibrant Hari Raya celebrations was met with great enthusiasm as it was our first school-based assembly celebrations, after two years of safe-management measures. The celebrations featured a traditional dance performance by the Ethnic Dance CCA titled &lsquo;Joget Aidilfitri&rsquo; (Aidilfitri Dance) as well as melodious song performances by our Secondary 3 Muslim students entitled &lsquo;Suasana Hari Raya&rsquo;. These beautiful performances certainly added to the festive cheer and struck a chord with the Damaians.</p>
<p>This year, students were encouraged to participate in a Hari Raya Tik Tok challenge prior to the concert. They had to perform a series of dance steps with their school mates based on a viral Hari Raya &lsquo;Tik Tok&rsquo; dance video. Some of the best and most creative dance clips were showcased during the assembly, much to everyone&rsquo;s delight. Finally, to close the celebrations, the students enthusiastically participated in a Hari Raya quiz and were treated to a video made by the Info-Communications Club that collated Hari Raya greetings from various CCAs and staff.</p>
<p>Indeed, the concert was a memorable event to mark the first assembly of the year!</p>
