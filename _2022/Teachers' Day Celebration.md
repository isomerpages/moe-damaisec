<p>Teachers&rsquo; Day is celebrated to recognise and appreciate our teachers&rsquo; unwavering efforts to grow our students to reach their goals. This year&rsquo;s programme was a special one as we gathered as a school physically for the first time in 2.5 years for a concert and celebrations.</p>
<p>The Student Council planned an exciting morning programme with a lively concert, souvenirs for the teachers and class party celebrations, helmed by the class committees. The Performing Arts CCAs came together to put up upbeat and heartfelt performances that had the audience tapping to the music. The concert also included teacher trivia segments which required students to guess the identities of the featured teachers. The highlight of the day was a surprise item by a team of musically inclined teachers, who came together to perform a surprise medley of songs that included &lsquo;My Universe&rsquo; by Coldplay and BTS, &lsquo;Flashlight&rsquo; by Jessie J and &lsquo;Try Everything&rsquo; by Shakira. Back at the class parties, teachers were treated to food, snacks and lots of gifts of appreciation from their grateful students.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the school staff adjourned for a sumptuous lunch at Holiday Inn Singapore, kindly sponsored by the School Advisory Committee. Put together by the Staff Welfare Committee, it was an afternoon of more laughs, humour and lots of lucky draw winners! The staff had a great time bonding with one another through the games, photo-booth and tucking into the 8 course meal. The day ended with all staff feeling happy with a gift or two in hand!</p>
