<p>Damai Secondary&rsquo;s 5th Speech and Prize-Giving Ceremony was held on 7 July 2022, after a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Celebrating the phenomenal achievements of our students in academic pursuits as well as co-curricular activities, it was a memorable and heart-warming celebration of our school&rsquo;s motto: Aspire, Explore and Achieve. The Guzheng players, members of the Choir and Ethnic Dancers put up stunning performances to celebrate this momentous occasion, where awards were given out to deserving students for their stellar academic and non-academic achievements.</p>
<p>The return of the student audience and having the proud family and friends of our award recipients present at the ceremony gave Speech Day 2022 a lively ambience. We are enormously proud of all our Damaians&rsquo; accomplishments and dedication to the school.&nbsp; Congratulations once again to all the award recipients for making Speech Day 2022 a joyous and meaningful event!</p>
