<p><strong>China Immersion Programme 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Exploring Culture, Experiencing School Life, and Expanding Horizons</em></strong>
</p>
<p>From 1 to 6 June 2025, a group of secondary 3 students had the opportunity
to participate in the China Immersion Programme, travelling to Suzhou and
Shanghai for a six-day educational and cultural experience. The trip was
designed to deepen students’ understanding of Chinese culture, foster global
awareness, and allow them to engage meaningfully with peers from another
country.</p>
<p>One of the key highlights of the trip was the student exchange programme
at Xinghai Experimental School (Junior High) in Suzhou. Students were paired
with local buddies and they joined the latter in regular classes, gaining
first-hand experience of the Chinese educational system. They observed
different classroom dynamics, teaching styles and school routines, which
broadened their perspective on learning beyond their own school environment.
This immersive experience encouraged students to reflect on the similarities
and differences in educational practices between Singapore and China. Many
were inspired by the discipline and enthusiasm shown by their Chinese peers,
and appreciated the opportunity to build friendships across borders.</p>
<p>At Xinghai Experimental School, students also explored the school’s impressive
robotics club, where they interacted with cutting-edge technology such
as an AI chess player and tried their hands at flying drones. This exposure
gave students a glimpse into how innovation and education intersect in
China.</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, students explored several cultural and historical
landmarks. In Suzhou, they visited Tongli Ancient Town, where they wandered
through narrow canals, historic residences and ancient bridges that dated
back hundreds of years. A visit to the Suzhou Silk Museum allowed them
to learn about the city’s renowned silk heritage, from traditional weaving
methods to modern textile innovations.</p>
<p>Students also visited the Oriental Pearl Tower in Shanghai, which not
only offered breathtaking views but also, insights into Shanghai’s development
as a global city. These visits helped students understand how tradition
and modernity co-exist in China’s rapidly evolving landscape.</p>
<p>Cultural appreciation also came alive through food. Students had the opportunity
to try local delicacies such as the famous <em>squirrel fish</em>, a sweet
and sour Suzhou specialty. A visit to a traditional Chinese teahouse allowed
them to experience tea appreciation. These hands-on experiences gave students
a deeper appreciation of Chinese customs and values.</p>
<p>Throughout the trip, students developed greater cultural sensitivity and
adaptability. Navigating new environments, communicating across language
barriers, and reflecting on cultural practices helped them become more
open-minded and empathetic individuals.</p>
<p>Many students shared that the experience had deepened their interest in
Chinese language and culture, while others expressed a newfound respect
for cultural diversity. The trip also strengthened their independence,
teamwork and confidence - valuable skills that extend far beyond academics.</p>
<p>The China Immersion Programme was not just a school trip - it was a journey
of discovery, connection and growth. Students returned with lasting memories,
new friendships and a broader understanding of the world around them.</p>
