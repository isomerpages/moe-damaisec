<p><strong>Student Leaders' Investiture 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>The 2025 Student Leaders Investiture was a meaningful celebration of service
and new beginnings. As the torch was passed, newly appointed CCA Leaders
and Peer Support Leaders received their badges and certificates, ready
to lead with heart and purpose. With pride and gratitude, the school honoured
the 2024 Leaders Council for their dedication. The investiture of the 2025
Leaders Council marked a defining moment, as each member pledged their
commitment to serve the school community. The ceremony closed on a hopeful
note, inspired by the passion of our student leaders stepping confidently
into their new responsibilities.</p>
