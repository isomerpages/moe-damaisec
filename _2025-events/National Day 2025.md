<p><strong>Damai National Day SG60 Carnival 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>On 8 August 2025, the school celebrated Singapore’s 60<sup>th</sup> birthday
with a vibrant National Day Carnival at Temasek Polytechnic. The event
brought the entire school together in a fun-filled celebration of sport,
camaraderie and the nation’s shared values.</p>
<p>From high-energy Zone Ball matches to friendly but competitive teacher-student
relay, the morning was packed with moments that reflected our shared journey
- resilience, openness, boldness and multicultural unity. Students and
staff embraced the carnival atmosphere, exploring sustainably and creatively
designed booths made by students for students across the various zones,
sampling tasty treats, and joining in the spirited sing-along of beloved
National Day songs.</p>
<p>Beyond the fun, the carnival served as a platform for transforming challenges
into opportunities. Whether stepping up to lead a booth, encouraging a
hesitant teammate, or adapting quickly when plans changed, Damaians demonstrated
how even small acts of initiative and teamwork can contribute to building
a stronger school and nation.</p>
<p>The National Day Carnival reminded everyone that together, we can continue
Building Our Singapore Together.</p>
