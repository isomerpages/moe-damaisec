<p>The Student Council Camp was held over two days during the June holidays.&nbsp;Although it was only a day camp this year, the Secondary Two and Three Student&nbsp;Councillors spent many hours bonding with one another. Apart from the usual&nbsp;energiser activities, the students learnt to speak confidently and plan a school&nbsp;event in detail. They also got a chance to be get creative in creating a unique&nbsp;Damai school cheer. All in all, the students found the camp meaningful in forging&nbsp;a new sense of identity as the 1st Student Council.</p>
