<p>Our Damai Staff Welfare Committee is committed to looking after the needs of&nbsp;our staff who play very important roles in our students&rsquo; learning process. We have&nbsp;planned various staff bonding activities that cater to the physical, intellectual,&nbsp;emotional and social well-being of our staff. These activities include learning journeys, birthday celebrations, in-house retail shopping and Values In Action&nbsp;(VIA) programmes. This year, our staff visited the Internal Security Department&nbsp;Heritage Centre, Gardenia Bread Factory and Institute of Mental health, as part of&nbsp;their educational learning journeys!</p>
