<p>Total Defence Day was an educational platform to learn about the five pillars of defence in Singapore as all students were engaged in level-based activities. Through the activities, students gained a variety of learning experiences that were led by our Uniformed Group students.</p>
<p>Some of the activities included the In-Place Protection (IPP), where students learnt how to protect themselves during a biological warfare by using everyday materials to seal their classrooms.</p>
<p>All in all, students learned basic survival skills to protect themselves and the nation in the event of a crisis or an attack.</p>
