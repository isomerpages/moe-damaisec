<p>This year marks our maiden Speech and Prize-Giving Day as a merged school. It was held on 7 April 2018 and kindly graced by the former Principal of Damai Secondary School, Mr Chow Weisi, as our Guest-of-Honour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mark this celebratory occasion, our new Principal, Ms Chan Wan Siong, gave a speech to welcome the guests. The following awards were presented: the Student Awards as well as Partner and Staff Awards. In addition, both the Choir and Modern Dance wowed the audience with their entertaining performances, adding to the joyous atmosphere. On this occasion, the new school song, composed by the former Principal of Bedok North Secondary, was unveiled to the members of the School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, parents and other guests for the first time.</p>
