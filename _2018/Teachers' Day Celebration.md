<p>The Student Council and the PE department organised this year&rsquo;s celebration with a class party and student-teacher games conducted in the morning, followed by an entertaining concert for the teachers. The theme for this year&rsquo;s celebration is &lsquo;Superheroes&rsquo; &ndash; celebrating our teachers as our everyday heroes. Our teachers also received handmade gifts &ndash; flowers and key chains depicting famous superheroes. Our&nbsp;councillors had a great time organising and executing the concert and the joy can be&nbsp;seen on our students&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; faces during the celebration.</p>
