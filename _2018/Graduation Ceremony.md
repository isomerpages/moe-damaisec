<p>The Class of 2018 made history by being the first graduating cohort of students from Damai Secondary School after the merger. The significant ceremony marked the start of a new exciting chapter in their lives at the end of secondary school. Ms Chan, our Principal, exhorted the graduating students to take away with them good memories and values learnt and sustain the friendships that they have forged as they continue their life journey. She presented students with the Singapore Schools Sports Council Colours Award and Form Teachers presented a student in each class the Outstanding Student of the Class Award. Ex-Presidents of the Student Council, Ameerah and Moira, reminisced about their days in secondary school and credited their growth as a student and leader to the school, teachers and classmates. Each class also paid tribute to their teachers who had walked the journey with them with videos and speeches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Message on the Best Wishes Banner to the graduating cohort:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Imagine with all your mind<br /></strong></em><em><strong>Believe with all your heart<br /></strong></em><em><strong>Achieve with all your might</strong></em></p>
<p>We believe all Damaians can achieve all that you imagine and hope to achieve. Keep these dreams alive by believing in yourselves with all of your heart and putting in your best effort.</p>
<p>Wishing the Class of 2018 Damaians all the very best in the national examinations and in all you do in the years to come!</p>
