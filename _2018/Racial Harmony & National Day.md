<p>The Racial Harmony Day performance on 16 July 2018 was entitled &ldquo;Harmony in Diversity&rdquo; and it showcased our individual talents from Damai Secondary School. Our integrated performance highlighted the importance of racial and religious harmony. Despite our diverse backgrounds such as our nationality, race and religion, we want to celebrate our differences through music and arts.</p>

<p>The international students choreographed a dance item and sang to the song that was played on the Guzheng. The performance showcased their talents and the strong camaraderie amongst them. It was also an opportunity to learn about the traditional Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Staff and students of Damai Secondary School commemorated National Day on 8 August 2018 by watching a local film entitled &lsquo;The Wayang Kids&rsquo;. It is a film that teaches everyone the importance of patience and understanding, and how we can be concerned citizens of the nation through our everyday interactions. The movie also emphasises the importance of our national identity which is made up of the various aspects of our cultural and racial groups in Singapore. As such, it allows us to explore our differences and reinforce a common identity with the differences. The movie was complemented by our CCE lesson and discussion on how to be an inclusive society, where we accept and celebrate our differences.</p>
