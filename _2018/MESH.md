<p>M.E.S.H is an abbreviation for the Mathematics, English, Science and Humanities departments in Damai Secondary School that came together in a collaboration to provide students with an authentic learning experience in one single platform.</p>
<p>The trail was carried out on 24th October 2018 as a post-exam activity for Secondary Three Normal (Academic) students at Little India. The objective of the programme is to bring students on an authentic learning experience that engages their senses. At the same time, students will get to learn more about the India heritage.</p>
<p>Students went around 4 stations at Serangoon Road, Campbell Lane, Tekka Centre and Indian Heritage Centre to answer Mathematics, English, Science and Humanities based questions on their ipads. Back in school, they got to know 7 spices a bit better and did a lab-testing on the acidity of each spice. MESH concluded with a quiz in the form of food sampling. Students sampled 7 dishes in small portions and completed a quiz to guess the spice used in the respective dish. The plate of food served included Cumin Rice, Fennel Carrots, Fish in Tamarind Gravy, Star Anise-Tea-Egg, Cinnamon Muffin, Lime Jelly and Cardamom Tea.</p>
<p>MESH was a unique experience for both the teachers and students. For many, it was their first time being in Little India and getting to try the various activities planned for the day.</p>
