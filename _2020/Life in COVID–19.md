<p>The COVID-19 crisis has swept through the entire world for most of 2020, creating an unparalleled wave of uncertainty and gloom. Educational institutions, from pre-schools through to universities, have experienced sudden and unprecedented disruption. In Singapore, schools had to shift to Home-Based Learning from 8 April to 1 June 2020 and a Blended Learning Experience from 1-28 June 2020. Teachers and students had to familiarize themselves with new ways of virtual learning and becoming self-directed learners. Studying from home and video conferencing have become part of the new norms that many have had to adapt to &ndash; our students and teachers included.</p>
<p>Since Phase 2 (29 June 2020), lessons in schools have resumed under a new normal. Safe management measures in schools continue to keep our students safe, such as mandatory wearing of masks, daily temperature-taking, social distancing, increased personal hygiene, regular wipe-down routines of high-touch surfaces and reduced intermingling between classes and levels. Their smiles may be hidden behind masks, but from the crinkles of the students&rsquo; eyes and the spring in their steps, it was clear that students still enjoyed coming to school and learning with their friends. The COVID-19 crisis has been a challenge, but it can also be a time for new opportunities in learning and innovation. We are stronger together!</p>
