<p>The school celebrated Chinese New Year on Friday, 24 January 2020. The celebration was a blast as we enjoyed the traditional Lion Dance performance, exciting modern dance sequences, melodious Choral arrangements and mesmerising Guzheng performances. The concert was also full of laughs and fun as teachers and students took part in various Chinese New Year related games and activities. Student representatives from Secondary 4 Higher Chinese class wore traditional costumes and gave an excellent presentation on the unique Chinese costumes as well. Through these lively celebrations, the students were immersed in the joyous festive atmosphere, they learnt more about the significance of Chinese New Year and different elements of Chinese culture. Our very own God of Fortune ended the celebration by sending his well wishes to everyone present and graced the grand finale of tossing Yu Seng with the teachers and staff of the school. Cheers to a prosperous 2020!</p>
