<p>We celebrated Singapore&rsquo;s 55th birthday on 7 August 2020, Friday, based on the theme &ldquo;Together, A Stronger Singapore&rdquo;. This year&rsquo;s theme is a rallying call to Singaporeans to play our part to band together and work towards a stronger Singapore, in spite of difficulties and crises. This year was also the first time we had a virtual synchronous National Day celebrations!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our E-National Day commemorative programme started a pre-recorded Observance Parade involving 14 representatives from our uniformed groups. Our Principal, Ms Chan, also presented the National Day message. Our National Day celebrations then continued with a National Day quiz, and a sing-along session of heartwarming National Day songs as well as classroom activities where students expressed their gratitude and aspirations for Singapore. Happy 55th birthday Singapore!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Every National Day, we remind ourselves that Singapore is a nation whose story is worth celebrating, whose history is worth cherishing, and whose future is worth building.</em>"&nbsp;</p>
