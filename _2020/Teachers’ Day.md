<p>We ended an exceptionally long Term 3 2020 with our annual Teachers' Day celebrations. This year&rsquo;s event was specially designed to thank all our teachers for all their hard work and selflessness in ensuring our students&rsquo; learning and welfare was always taken off, even during the Full Home-Based Learning period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The celebrations consisted of virtual celebrations organised by the Student Council during a special one-hour segment. A series of quizzes such as Guess-the-Teacher and Teacher Trivia was held to engage the teachers and classes. The students also created a video to thank their teachers for their constant care and support and shared various interesting nuggets of memories they had of their teachers. Then, the Student Councillors collaborated with class leaders to facilitate class-based celebrations as they thanked their various teachers through good food and games. Thank you teachers for everything you have been to the students and the school during this year and every year!</p>
