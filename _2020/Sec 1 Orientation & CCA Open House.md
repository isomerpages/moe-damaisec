<p>The Secondary One Orientation is a week-long induction programme during which student leaders welcome our new Secondary One students to the Damai family as they adapt and familiarise themselves to the new learning environment. This year, the student leaders ran the two-day programme for the Secondary One students, in partnership with the Form Teachers and Year Heads. Activities and talks were planned for the Secondary One students to inculcate a sense of belonging to their form classes and the school.</p>
<p>The new Secondary One students were also introduced to the various exciting Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) offered at Damai Secondary School during the Secondary One Orientation Programme. Student leaders from the CCAs, together with their teachers, organised the CCA Open House which aimed to enthuse and engage the Secondary One students in choosing a CCA to enrich their secondary school experience. The Secondary One students also had a chance to try their hand at different CCAs in January, before making their final choice. Welcome to the Damai family Secondary Ones 2020!</p>
