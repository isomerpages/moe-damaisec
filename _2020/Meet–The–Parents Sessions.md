<p>Parents are the school&rsquo;s key partners. Meet the Parents Session will give parents a better understanding of their child&rsquo;s learning experience and outcomes in school.</p>
<p>In January/February 2020, the Student Development Team organised the first series of Meet-the-Parents (MTP) sessions for our students. The MTP sessions were carried out on the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondary One Level &ndash; 3 January 2020</li>
<li>Secondary Two Level &ndash; 10 January 2020</li>
<li>Secondary Four/Five Level &ndash; 17 January 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents were kept abreast of the different school programmes, classroom practices and academic requirements of the level that their child is in, through the Principal&rsquo;s talk. Parents were also able to interact with their child&rsquo;s Form Teachers. Through the MTP sessions, the school hopes to achieve stronger partnership with parents in the holistic development of the child.</p>
