<p>On 2 October 2020, our Secondary 4 and 5 students celebrated their Graduation Day. We held class-based celebrations where our Principal, Ms Chan Wan Siong and Assistant Year Head, Ms Diyana, presented awards to students from each graduating class who had excelled in 2020 as well as wished them well in their future endeavours. We traced their journey as a Damaian over the last four years through a colourful video montage, before everyone received the School Magazine as a fitting farewell gift. Lastly, classes spent valuable time with their form teachers and friends to commemorate this special day.</p>
<p>To all Secondary 4 and 5 students, all the best for your national examinations and we wish you the best in your future endeavours!</p>
