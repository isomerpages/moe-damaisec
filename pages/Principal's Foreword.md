<h4><strong>Principal's Message 2026</strong></h4>
<p>A warm welcome to Damai Secondary School (DSS) – a school at the edge
of the reservoir!</p>

<p>I am excited to join the Damai family as its second principal and am humbled
to continue the work of a community shaped by care, commitment, and dedication.</p>
<p>Damai Secondary School was established in 2018 through the merger of Bedok
North Secondary School (founded in 1981) and Damai Secondary School (founded
in 1994). While our history brings together two rich legacies, our shared
purpose remains clear. Over the past 8 years, we have remained steadfast
in helping every Damaian <strong>Aspire, Explore and Achieve</strong>, so
that each student may find <strong>purpose </strong>and <strong>meaning</strong> in
their lives.</p>
<p>Through my interactions with staff and parents, I am deeply moved by the
life-giving work of our teachers, who go the extra mile to care, give hope
and bring out the best in every student – nurturing them as curious learners,
empathetic and confident communicators, resilient youths, and leaders with
a generous spirit.</p>
<p>Our approach is guided by 3 enduring commitments: &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First, Damai is a school that is family-oriented</strong>, where
relationships, care, and trust form the heart of growing and learning.
For many of our students, the school is a second home, and for some it
is their first home!</p>
<p>We strive to build an environment where every child feels safe, known,
and valued. This is especially important for some students who look to
school for stability, encouragement, and a strong sense of belonging. Our
greatest strength lies in our caring and committed teachers who invest
time and effort to build meaningful connections with both students and
parents.</p>
<p>Through Form Teacher Time, Character and Citizenship lessons, Co-Curricular
Activities (CCAs), Values in Action, and level camps, students build positive
relationships with their teachers, form friendships across diverse backgrounds,
and grow in respect, empathy, and a shared sense of community. We also
place a strong focus on peer support – <em>for peers by peers</em> – recognising
that student voice can be transformational in empowering greater student
agency and ownership. Every class is supported by peer support leaders
who play an important role in strengthening peer bonds, encouraging peer
helping, and modelling positive peer influence at the class, CCA, and school
levels.</p>
<p>We are therefore a family that grows, learns, and flourishes together.</p>
<p><strong>Second, Damai is a school that is aspiration-focused</strong>,
where students are guided to explore their identity, make choices, and
act with purpose.</p>
<p>Undergirding this commitment is the belief that every student has strengths
waiting to be discovered. And regardless of their starting point, they
can achieve their goals if they have the right <strong>mindset</strong>  <strong>(“I am”) </strong>(e.g.
attitudes, beliefs),<strong> skillset</strong>  <strong>(“I can”)</strong> (e.g.
technical skills, soft skills), and “<strong>toolset”</strong>  <strong>(“I have”) </strong>(e.g.
resources). We are therefore deliberate in providing a range of experiences
to inspire, uplift and stretch our students.</p>
<p>Today, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is integrated within the total
curriculum through Science, Geography, and Values in Action, nurturing
students as <strong>stewards</strong> of the environment. Through our Learning
for Life Programme (LLP) in Water and Adventure Sports, students develop
as <strong>stewards</strong> of character, resilience, and leadership. Our
Education and Career Guidance initiatives and Internationalisation experiences
broaden students’ perspectives and cultivate them as <strong>stewards</strong> of
outwardness. Across these experiences, we remain committed to building
hope – helping students better understand themselves, explore possibilities,
build confidence through small successes, and take concrete steps toward
their goals.</p>
<p>Most notably, we are proud that many of our students challenge themselves
by taking subjects at more demanding levels and have secured post-secondary
pathways – even before sitting for the National Examinations – through
the Early Admissions Exercise. These outcomes do not happen by chance.
The growing numbers reflect our collective efforts to support students
in discovering and working towards their purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Third, Damai is a school that is community-anchored</strong>,
where we want our students to see themselves as part of something larger
– called to do good and to make a positive difference in our Bedok Reservoir
community.</p>
<p>We believe character finds its truest expression through action. Our students
learn to live out the values of <strong><em>Integrity, Respect, Resilience</em></strong>,
and <strong><em>Service</em></strong> by caring for one another and contributing
to the immediate community. These experiences shape not only responsible
students, but thoughtful and compassionate citizens.</p>
<p>Recently, five of our students came forward to help a lady who had slipped
at a bus stop and fractured her ankle. They called for help and ensured
she was cared for until the ambulance arrived. The lady wrote to us to
express her deep gratitude before undergoing surgery. We could not have
been prouder. Not because it was extraordinary – but because it was simply
right thing to do. A concept called <strong><em>Atarimae</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practising ‘<em>Atarimae</em>’</strong>
</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I shared with our students the Japanese concept of <strong><em>Atarimae</em></strong> –
doing what is “natural”, “obvious”, and “right” without needing to be told.
This mindset is evident in Japan, where it is almost instinctive for spectators
to clean up a stadium after a match, without reminders or instructions. <strong><em>Atarimae</em></strong> reflects
a quiet yet powerful mindset grounded in <em>shared responsibility, unspoken care, and everyday discipline.</em>
</p>
<p>What moved me deeply was not just the idea itself, but how our students
have responded to it since. Many have been struck by its simplicity. It
surfaced in the reflections during the Sec 3 camp. It appeared in the cheers
of our Netball girls during the B Division competition. And as I walk around
the school, I hear students calling out <strong><em>Atarimae</em></strong> –
sometimes playfully, sometimes thoughtfully. I am heartened, because it
tells me that the idea has meaning for them – and that we can build on
this momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Our Call to Action</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe every Damaian can practise <strong><em>Atarimae</em></strong><em>, anchored in </em>our
school values.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> – “<em>Doing the right thing because it is the right thing to do”. </em>This
begins with the self – having the courage to act rightly even when no one
is watching, and being disciplined, proactive, and curious in their daily
learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Respect</strong> – “<em>Treating others the way we would like to be treated”</em>.
This begins with simple gestures such as greeting staff and friends, which
build a culture of warmth and belonging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resilience – “</strong><em>You are not alone”</em>. This begins
with recognising that help-seeking is a strength</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <strong>Service</strong> – “<em>We care</em>”. This begins with playing
our part to keep the school clean and choosing kindness when others are
in need.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is therefore the culture we strive to nurture:</p>
<p><em>Where values are not merely taught but lived.<br>Where character is seen in everyday choices.<br>Where doing what is right becomes second nature.</em>
</p>
<p>Together with my staff, we look forward to partnering you – parents, alumni,
community and industry partners – to grow Damai as a family of learners
and stewards, where every child flourishes with purpose and meaning. If
this resonates with you, we welcome you to be part of the Damai heartbeat!</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Prashant s/o Jayapragas
<br>Principal</p>
