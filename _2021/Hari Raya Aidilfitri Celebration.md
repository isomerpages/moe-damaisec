<p>A mini celebration was held on 14th May to educate the non-Muslims as well as Muslims themselves on the meaning behind the month-long fasting month, also known as Ramadhan, and Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, did you know that unlike the Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Aidilfitri is not a Muslim New Year? Hence, it is inappropriate for you to wish a Muslim, 'Happy New Year' on that day. That knowledge is unbeknownst to some students or even staff. Through the PowerPoint presentation followed by a KAHOOT quiz conducted in class, students learnt nuggets of knowledge about Hari Raya celebration as well as Ramadhan. To end off the celebration, students were encouraged to pen down their Hari Raya wishes to their classmates and teachers through Padlet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not forgetting the Muslim staff, some of them don their traditional costumes to celebrate the happy occasion.&nbsp;</p>
