<p>Students and staff immersed themselves in the National Day celebration by participating in various activities. After the flag-raising ceremony, the day kicked off with the National Day video message and Recollections to remind us of our turbulent history that has shaped many current policies such as National Service, racial and religious harmony and ethnic integration policy, to name a few.</p>
