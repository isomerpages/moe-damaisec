<p>This year, the Chinese New Year celebration took place on 11th February. A one-hour in-class celebration was organised. Students were encouraged to bring snacks to class while enjoying the virtual performances.</p>
<p>Despite being unable to put up live performances, students were still given the opportunity to showcase their talents. Students from Guzheng, Modern Dance, Choir and Ethnic Dance submitted clips of their performances to celebrate the joyous occasion with the school. Our two emcees, Roxanne Chua (402) and Ho Yue Ling (301) also displayed great chemistry in the 40 minute video.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Secondary 4 Higher Chinese Class ended the celebration with a presentation and quiz on Chinese New Year to enlighten students on the Chinese culture.</p>
