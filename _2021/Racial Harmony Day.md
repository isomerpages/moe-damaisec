<p><strong>Secondary 1: Making Chinese Fans</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ms Nurmin, 104 FT</strong>: The Chinese Fan activity was simple yet meaningful. I saw how it brought out the creativity in some students. Now I know that some of them can draw very well and they take pride in producing master pieces!! They researched on designs and put their own touch to them! Some even got their fellow Chinese classmates to help them with the quotes!&nbsp;</p>
