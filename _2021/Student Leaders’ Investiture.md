<p>The 4th Student Leaders&rsquo; Investiture took on a different form this year. With the well-being of our students in mind, the ceremony was decentralised and held in the classrooms in line with the safe management measures. In the comfort of the classrooms, students celebrated the appointment of their fellow classmates as student leaders. Form teachers presented collar pins to the newly appointed leaders. The ceremony ended with a video, filmed by the 2020 Student Council Executive Committee. The video highlighted the student leaders&rsquo; efforts to rise above challenges in the past year and inspire their juniors to forge ahead in their leadership journey with meaning and purpose.</p>
