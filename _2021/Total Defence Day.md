<p><strong>Secondary 1: Creating a Ready Bag in times of emergency</strong></p>
<p><strong>105B, Mohammed Taufeeq</strong>: Our CCE lessons now are so much fun. We get to explore various issues and learn new things. For Total Defence Day, we had the opportunity to work together to prepare our emergency bags filled with necessities. Not only did we learn what should go into the emergency bags but also, why these items are so important.</p>

<p><strong>Ms Lorraine Ng</strong>: It was a wonderful opportunity for all cadets to learn first-aid from St John cadets and, they in turn, taught their classmates. The students have gained some knowledge of what they can do to help others in need.</p>
