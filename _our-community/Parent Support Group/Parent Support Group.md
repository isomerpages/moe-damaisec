<p>Parents play a key role in the growth and development of their children. As such, as key stakeholders, parents&rsquo; partnership with the school is critical.</p>
<p>PSG@Damai embraces the school vision and mission and actively supports the school&rsquo;s endeavours. The PSG members role model the school values, add value to the students&rsquo; school experience and serve as bridge between the school and other parents. The PSG supports and collaborates with the school in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serve as chaperones</li>
<li>Participate in school activities</li>
<li>Organize and conduct activities for families with the aim of forging familial bonds and building relationships.</li>
<li>Promote parenting skills through workshops and sharing sessions</li>
<li>Serve as a resource person&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
