A whole-school National Day Sports Carnival was held at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). Lower secondary students had fun and played traditional and carnival games that were designed by our secondary two students. The booths included Banana Archery, Hit the Cans! and Planking, just to name a few. Secondary three students participated in Traditional Games Telematch, where they played nostalgic games such as Capteh, hopping in a gunny sack and Hopscotch while the secondary four students played Inter-Class Volleyball games.

In addition, students and staff had a go at the Teacher-Student Telematch to complete stations that required cooperation and teamwork. Furthermore, all students and staff had fun playing other games such as Fast Hands and Soak and Wet. The former required players to catch the dropping targets in time before they land on the ground, putting their reaction skills to the test, while the latter required a brave soul to sit under a pail of water which poured water on the person once the target was hit by another individual!

The celebration came to a close with community singing of our National Day songs and prize presentation to classes and groups of students who won the various games or designed the most enjoyable and environmentally friendly carnival stalls. The sports carnival strengthened our Damaian identity as a school as well as our national identity of shared values and unity in diversity.</p>
