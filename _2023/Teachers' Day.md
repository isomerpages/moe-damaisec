<p>On the afternoon of 25th August, the school staff relished a scrumptious buffet lunch at Park Royal on Kitchener Road, generously sponsored by the School Advisory Committee. Organised by the Staff Welfare Committee, the luncheon turned into a lively afternoon filled with cheery laughter, fun and a host of lucky draw winners! The staff had a fantastic time strengthening their bonds through striking a pose or two at the photo-booth and playing games such as karaoke and charades while enjoying the delectable buffet spread. As the day came to a close, all staff members departed with smiles, having thoroughly enjoyed the event! </p>

<p>The Student Council, on the other hand, orchestrated an engaging Teachers' Day concert programme on 31st of August. The programme featured a lively concert, thoughtful tokens of appreciation for the teachers and school staff, and class parties organised by the student leaders. The various performing arts CCAs collaborated to deliver spirited and heart-felt performances, captivating the audience and setting toes tapping to the catchy &nbsp;rhythms. The concert also incorporated exciting segments where teachers and students interacted and competed against one another.</p>

<p>The highlight of the day was an unexpected performance by a group of musically talented teachers and students. They put together a mashup which included familiar hits such as 'See You Again' and 'A Million Dreams.' It was a remarkable moment for all! ðŸ˜Š</p>
