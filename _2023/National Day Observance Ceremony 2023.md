<p>On the 6 August 2023, students from our Uniformed Groups and Dragonboat CCA participated in the Bedok Reservoir-Punggol National Day Observance Ceremony 2023. It was an invaluable opportunity for our students to apply the skills that they had learnt during CCA, by partaking in a local community event.

During the parade segment, our Uniformed Group cadets marched in the state flag and led the audience in the recital of the national pledge. It was a proud and solemn moment for the cadets as they applied the parade drills which they had learnt in commemoration of our nationâ€™s birthday.</p>
