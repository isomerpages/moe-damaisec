<p>On the 6 August 2023, students from our Uniformed Groups and Dragonboat CCA participated in the Bedok Reservoir-Punggol National Day Observance Ceremony 2023. It was an invaluable opportunity for our students to apply the skills that they had learnt during CCA, by partaking in a local community event.

During the parade segment, our Uniformed Group cadets marched in the state flag and led the audience in the recital of the national pledge. It was a proud and solemn moment for the cadets as they applied the parade drills which they had learnt in commemoration of our nationâ€™s birthday.</p>

<p>Furthermore, our Dragonboat team was involved in the parade as part of the water contingent. They impressed the audience with their deft and coordinated rowing and contributed to a more exciting event for all. The sight of the vessels coming in to berth at the front of the parade square added to the grandeur of the event.</p>

<p>All in all, the event was a memorable one for our students and will certainly be one of their highlights for 2023. Through that experience, they strengthened their sense of belonging to the local community and nation. It was an opportunity for them to bond with their CCA mates while developing important values such as resilience and teamwork.</p>
