<p>The Hari Raya concert was held on 15th May 2023 in the school hall. The half hour concert started with Hari Raya greetings from the various CCAs and committees. From the video presentations, the audience gathered information about why and how Hari Raya is celebrated and learnt how to tie the ‘samping’. The latter session came alive when a few non-Malay teachers volunteered to demonstrate the tying of the samping themselves. Another highlight of the concert was the silat demonstration by 3 brothers, led by  Raif from 404, who clinched a Silver medal in the Junior Male Artistic Single at the Sarawak Premier International Silat Championship, this year. During the concert, the emcees also highlighted the Mother Tongue Fortnight activities which the school embarked on, sharing the authentic learning experience students acquired via the Wau and Batik paintings essions for the secondary one cohort, basket weaving for the secondary two and the dikir barat and drama exposure for the secondary three. 

Ethnic dance performed a dance item to the Hari Raya song by Hael Husaini, “Bersyukur Seadanya”. The song was about celebrating Hari Raya joyously with loved ones but to be mindful not to be extravagant in spending. Instead, one should focus on spending quality family time and being grateful for all blessings. In summary, the half hour concert was something joyful and meaningful for all students despite their cultural background.  </p>
