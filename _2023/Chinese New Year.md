<p>With the ease of pandemic restrictions, the Year of Rabbit started with the great news of having a physical concert after so many years. Students were excited to gather back in the hall with their friends and immerse in the vibrancy of the celebration.

With great chemistry, our emcees, Tasya (301) and Snikitha (301), brought joy to the school, especially during the quiz item. Snikitha even challenged herself and spoke some Chinese words while introducing various programmes to the school. Other than the great effort put in by our emcees, students from Guzheng, Modern Dance, Ethnic Dance and Choir did not fail to awe the school with their outstanding performances. Finally, Jia Ming (402) appeared as the God of Fortune to bring prosperity for everyone before the celebration ended.&nbsp;

The physical concert not only heightened the festive atmosphere for everyone, it also educated students on Chinese culture.</p>
