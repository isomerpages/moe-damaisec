<p>As always, the Speech and Prize-Giving Day was a joyous moment for the school. That special day saw members of the staff, students, both past and present, and parents coming together to celebrate the attainment of our students as well as appreciate our teachers for their enduring commitment to the service. 

The event commenced with two entertaining musical items by the Guzheng Ensemble. Besides the award ceremony, other highlights included a divine performance by the Ethnic Dance group, showcasing lively music, energetic moves and vibrant colours. Not to be outdone, Modern Dance gave a well-choreographed and beautifully executed rendition of a dance entitled Undaunted.

It was indeed a day of smiles and joy!
