<h4>Graduation Day 2023</h4><p>
On 28 September 2023, we bid adieu to our graduating Secondary 4 and 5 students. The lively and heartwarming celebration marked the culmination of our graduating students' years of hard work and memorable time spent at Damai Secondary. The 2023 graduating cohort experiencing the most dynamic secondary school experience and their positive mindset, enthusiasm and zest for life will always be fondly cherished.

Our Graduation Day celebrations were held as a cohort in the school hall. Dressed in their class t-shirts, the students reminisced together on their memorable years at Damai Secondary, from starting secondary school in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, embracing technology in their learning and transitioning to a new normal secondary-school life in Upper Secondary. The students roared with delight as they competed in the Damai Trivia quiz to test their knowledge of the school, a place that had become a second home to them over the years.

Each classâ€™ Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) then led in heart-warming class-tributes to their form and subject teachers who had guided them on their academic journey and shared words of encouragement to their fellow classmates in their future endeavours. Through their heartfelt words, the PSLs not only acknowledged the pivotal role of their form teachers but also reaffirmed their hard and heart work. Their tributes were a testament to the care and compassion of Damai teachers and a reminder of the friendships forged within the class.

As the curtains closed on the graduation day celebrations, graduands were left with a final message from Year Head, Ms Lenny, reminding them to always embrace the little things in life, beyond books and grades. The students then, tucked into a sumptuous lunch as they laughed, joked, and snapped numerous photo memories for a lifetime. With lots of laughter and some tears, students wrapped up the event by writing well wishes and parting words on one another's T shirt, signifying the indelible marks they have left on each other's secondary school life.

Class of 2023, we wish you the very best. Always reach for your dreams and continue to grow with purpose and meaning beyond Damai.</p>
