<p>The commemoration of Total Defence Day is a solemn reminder to all of us that we cannot take peace and harmony for granted. Each of us has a role to play in strengthening social ties, knowing what to do during emergencies, lending a helping hand to those in need and being vigilant at all times including in the cyberspace. 

Our CCE lessons this year highlighted the issue of high level of food wastage in Singapore and how it could affect Singapore’s food security. Students also learnt that we can give ‘ugly food’ a chance to keep our food sources secure and sustainable. Students also gained greater awareness of Singapore’s ‘30 by 30’ initiative of meeting 30% of our nutritional needs locally and sustainably by 2030, and how we can support the ongoing initiative by purchasing local produce.
