<p>The 6th Student Leadersâ€™ Investiture was held over two mornings, on 17 and 18 April this year. On 17 April 2023, the Student Councillors and CCA Leaders were invested during the morning assembly in the hall. Our Vice-Principal, Mrs Oh, presented the Student Councillors with collar pins and certificates of appointment. The outgoing CCA Leaders were also called on stage to pass the baton (represented by collar pins) to the incoming CCA Leaders of 2023. Additionally, the Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) were also formally recognised. The hall was filled with exuberant cheers and rounds of applause from our Damaians for their friends who were student leaders. During the morning Form Teacher Time on 18 April, the PSLs of each class were each presented with a collar pin by their Form Teachers. The investiture was a momentous occasion for our Student Leaders in Damai Secondary School. Aspire, Explore, Achieve! </p>
