<p>On 5 August 2023, our Ethnic Dance students had the rare opportunity to perform at the <i>Kaki Bukit National Day Dinner</i> in conjunction with the National Day. Our dancers trained hard to ensure that they put up a spectacular performance at that community event. Their efforts bore fruit as their performance was very well-received by the audience. Resounding applause could be heard at the end of their performance. Additionally, they were given positive feedback which delighted them.</p>
