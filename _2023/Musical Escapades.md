The Damai School Band was invited to perform at the event, _Musical Escapades_, the largest Wind Band Marathon in Singapore, at Jewel Changi on 6 August 2023.

The captivating musical journey started with the soulful melodies of _Tanah di Bawah Angin_ and Adele’s _Rolling in the Deep,_ and proceeded on to the electrifying Taylor Swift’s 1989 medley, taking the audience on a musical roller-coaster.

To celebrate the spirit of unity and diversity that makes Singapore truly unique, the band commemorated National Day with the song _Home_ which reflects the essence of our home, our roots, and the journey that we have travelled together.

The band concluded the performance with the adrenaline-thumping _Gurenge_ from the popular series, Demon Slayer.

The thunderous applause from the parents and siblings of the talented musicians and the public added an extra layer of warmth and pride to the performers, fuelling their passion to give their very best.</p>
