<p>On 19 February 2019 afternoon, class committee members from all levels attended a two and a half hours training session organised by the Student Council teachers. By the end of the session, the members were equipped with essential skills to carry out their duties and responsibilities more effectively and confidently. The training session started off with a sharing on leadership by Student Council teachers. After which, students broke out into smaller teams and underwent training designed to meet their specific roles. The session ended off with the recapitulation of &lsquo;Model the Way&rsquo; and &lsquo;Challenge the Process&rsquo; concepts from &ldquo;The Leadership Challenge Framework&rdquo; by James Kouzes and Barry Posner, and an online reflection by the students to consolidate their learning.</p>
