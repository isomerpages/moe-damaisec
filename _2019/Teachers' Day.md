<p>On 5 September 2019, our students and staff had an enjoyable and meaningful time bonding over food and games at the Bedok Reservoir Park. It was heartening to see students sharing their food prepared for the picnic with their schoolmates and teachers. Students also took the opportunity to thank their teachers for their effort and hard work put in throughout the year.</p>
<p>After the picnic, students and staff were treated to a concert performance in the school hall, where the performers wowed their audience with music, dance, songs and games. The concert ended with a video and presentation of handmade cards by the Class Leaders and Student Councillors in showing appreciation to the teachers.</p>
