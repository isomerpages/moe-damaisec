<p>In conjunction with Aesthetics Week, each level commemorated Racial Harmony Day by creating, designing and expressing their creativity. The secondary one students designed a class calendar for Year 2020. The calendars included the important festive celebrations of all races in Singapore. The secondary two students expressed their artistic creativity in their joint design on a giant T-shirt. They included sketches of various places of worship and the cultural icons. The secondary three students took part in an inter-class costume design activity in which they had to dress up a student, and the costume included elements of the four main races and cultures in Singapore. Last but not least, the secondary four and five students designed their tote bags with cultural elements, cultural foods and language. The students had an enjoyable time and displayed their talents and originality in their designs.</p>
