<p>The week-long event kicked off with Damai&rsquo;s very first talent competition, Damai Spotlight, on July 15. The finalists competed live on stage to an enthusiastic audience of students and staff, treating them to stunning performances of song and dance. Over the next few days, students from the Visual and Performing Arts Co-Curricular Activities groups entertained the lunch time crowd with a slew of aesthetics performances. These included flash mobs by the Modern and Ethnic dance groups, as well as musical performances by the Choir, Guzheng, Band CCAs and the Damai Spotlight finalists.&nbsp; Adding on to the vibrant week, there was a screening of music videos that were created by our very own students during&nbsp; their Art and Music lessons. The Visual and Art club also showcased their creative paper mache art works on food.</p>
