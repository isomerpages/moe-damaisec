<p>As part of the school&rsquo;s programme in encouraging our students to be active contributors to the nation, the Secondary One cohort carried out a fundraising campaign for the National Kidney Foundation (NKF). With knowledge gained from their learning journey to the Kidney Discovery Centre at NKF, the students were sensitive to the feelings of the patients they visited at the various dialysis centres. They brought much cheer and warmth to the patients who were undergoing long hours of treatment. In addition, the students also did their part in raising awareness about kidney health to family and friends through posts on their social media accounts. With their active contributions, the students were strong advocates of the importance of individual holistic health management and healthy living.</p>
