<p>The Secondary Two Collaborative Learning Journey for Humanities was an integration of departmental practices. Students visited the National Gallery Singapore on 7 March and 14 March 2019 and were exposed to the integration of subjects like History, Art and English Literature. Together with a customised Learning Journey booklet, the students studied paintings and sculptures that were focused on life in Singapore during the 1940s and 1950s. Through this experience, they were able to distinguish the style of painting and evolution of art through the years. Students also analysed the different perspectives locals in Singapore had towards the theme of memories, identities and histories.</p>
