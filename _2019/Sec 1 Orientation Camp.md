<p>The 3-day and 2-night camp from 2 to 4 January 2019 organised by the Student Leadership Development Team aimed to equip our new Secondary One students with skills to cope with the transition from primary school to secondary school. It also provided opportunities for students to get to know the school environment better and strengthen teacher-student and student-student interactions, thereby building strong positive relationships as a foundation for the students&rsquo; secondary school years. Through the camp, the new cohort built camaraderie and esprit de corps with a strong sense of belonging to the school.</p>
