<p>As part of the school&rsquo;s continued collaboration with our community and SG Cares, Secondary Two students embarked on the VIA with Kaki Bukit Residents&rsquo; Committee. They prepared and planned craft work, games and performances to provide entertainment and joy to the elderly. Some took lead in preparing snacks, materials and Bingo cards. The elderly had a fun time and it was a meaningful afternoon spent with one another.</p>
