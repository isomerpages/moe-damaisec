<p>In January 2019, the Student Development Team organised the first series of Meet-the-Parents (MTP) sessions for all five levels of our students. The MTP sessions were successfully carried out on the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondary One Level &ndash; 3 January 2019</li>
<li>Secondary Two Level &ndash; 11 January 2019</li>
<li>Secondary Three Level &ndash; 4 January 2019</li>
<li>Secondary Four/Five Level &ndash; 18 January 2019</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents were kept abreast of the different programmes and academic requirements of the level that their child is in through the principal&rsquo;s talk. Parents were also able to interact with their child&rsquo;s Form Teachers. Through the MTP sessions, the school hopes to achieve stronger partnership with parents in the holistic development of the child</p>
