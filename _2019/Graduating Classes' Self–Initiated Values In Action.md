<p>This year the Secondary Four and Five cohort was entrusted with upholding the school value of responsibility through initiating their own Values In Action (VIA) projects. They were tasked to source, correspond and finalise details of the VIA activity with the organisation of their choice. As such, they were made to engage their hearts and heads as they negotiated and decided within their groups and the organisations regarding their project. Consequently, this led to them engaging various organisations supporting the elderly and children, namely, Thye Hua Kwan and PCF Sparkletots for their VIA projects. Many have found the experience enriching and fulfilling.</p>
