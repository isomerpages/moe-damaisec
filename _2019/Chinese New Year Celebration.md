<p>On 4 February, our school celebrated Chinese New Year with a two hours concert. Students from Guzheng, Modern Dance, Ethnic Dance, Choir and Boys&rsquo; Brigade entertained the teachers and students with their performances and brought the festive cheers to the maximum level. Students also learnt more about the Chinese New Year beliefs and customs by watching related videos and they were very enthusiastic in participating in the quiz conducted by our two bubbly emcees, Emma (Sec 403) and Cindy (Sec 301). Our alumnae, Chantelli, also charmed the audience with her Latin dance performance. For the first time in Damai Secondary school, a student, Jia Yuzhe from Sec 103, put up a performance with his father, singing a popular Chinese New Year song, &ldquo;Gong Xi Gong Xi&rdquo;. The finale of the concert was the entrance of the two &ldquo;Fortune Gods&rdquo; dressed up by our own students, Galton Toh and Quek Jun Kang from 501, followed by a splendid Lion Dance performance.</p>
