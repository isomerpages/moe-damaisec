<p>This year&rsquo;s commemoration of Total Defence Day serves to remind us the various pillars of Total Defence and how each and everyone one of us can and must do a part in the defence of Singapore. Secondary One students learnt lashing and Secondary Two students experienced outdoor cooking. Outdoor cooking and possessing the skill of constructing everyday objects such as clothes line are essential survival skills in times of emergency. Secondary Three students underwent an In-Place Protection simulation of a bio-chemical warfare attack. They sealed their classrooms using everyday items and learnt to protect themselves in the event of similar circumstances. The Secondary Four and Five students deepened their knowledge on SG Secure through a series of activities that taught them the importance of vigilance, civil defence and first aid and cyberterrorism.</p>
<p>Students were also engaged in a Black Market quiz on National Education during recess and won special snacks in addition to the sweet potato porridge sold in the canteen.</p>
