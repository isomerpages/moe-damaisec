<p>As part of the school&rsquo;s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in developing character and leadership through water sports, and a sense of belonging to the nation, the Secondary Three cohort carried out waterways clean-up on kayaks at Kallang Waterways. The students also did their part in spreading messages on anti-littering and to advocate for cleaner waterways. Through the Save the Earth exhibition, the students displayed artefacts and posters to encourage their schoolmates to be responsible global citizens.</p>
