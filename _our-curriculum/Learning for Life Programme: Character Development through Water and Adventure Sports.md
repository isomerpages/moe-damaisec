<p>The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) provides students with real-life
experiences to develop character and values, cultivate positive attitudes,
self-expression and strengthen their people skills. The focus area for
our school's LLP is <em>Character Development through Water and Adventure Sports</em>.</p>
<p>The LLP is aligned to the school's vision and mission of developing students
who lead purposeful and meaningful lives guided by strong moral values
and a spirit to explore their interests and talents. Through authentic
learning experiences in water and adventure sports, the programme develops
character, leadership and citizenship competencies in our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Level Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Secondary One &amp; Two – Introduction to Water &amp; Adventure Sports</strong>
</p>
<p>Character and leadership development starts in secondary one through the
Water &amp; Adventure Sports Camp. The camp introduces students to Water
&amp; Adventure Sports and provides an avenue for students to forge new
friendships and bond with their peers and camp leaders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lower Secondary students continue their LLP journey with the Sports Education
Programme (SEP), where they begin to explore their own interests through
electives such as hiking, rock-climbing and other adventure sports.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Three – Service, Community and Citizenship</strong>
</p>
<p>Secondary three students take part in the Outward Bound Singapore Challenge
Programme or the school-based cohort camp experience. Through the residential
camp, students develop resilience, teamwork and the courage to overcome
obstacles in life.</p>
<p>Secondary three students also attend the Dragonboat Orientation Programme,
where they learn the importance of teamwork and resilience. Beyond that,
students also learn about the rich cultural significance the sport holds
in Singapore and the region.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Four – Lifelong Learning and Beyond</strong>
</p>
<p>The highlight of the Secondary four LLP is the Water Sports Electives.
Students will further explore their interest in a variety of water sports
such as surfing, stand-up paddling and scuba-diving. Students learn to
step out of their comfort zone and begin a lifelong journey beyond the
school gates.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Water Sports CCA</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The school offers two water sports CCA in line with our LLP for students
who wish to pursue their interests at a higher level. Students who are
keen can apply to join the Canoeing (girls) or Dragonboat (boys) CCA, where
they will train under professional coaches and take part in competitive
races.&nbsp;</p>
