<p>The Damai Dragonboat team is an exhilarating water sports CCA that is part of the school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dragonboat team challenges its members to go beyond their limits. Challenging weekly training sessions hone the students' skills and techniques and teach them the value of resilience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Covid has put the brakes on the consistency and intensity of our water training. While adjusting our efforts to make the best of the situation, we have become more hungry and cannot wait for normalcy to return, so that we may embrace our training as a team on the water!</p>
