<p>The Damai Dragonboat is an exhilarating water sports CCA which is an integral
part of the school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP). This dynamic CCA
challenges its students to push beyond their limits, fostering essential
values such as discipline, dedication, resilience and teamwork. Through
rigorous weekly training sessions, students hone their skills and techniques,
learning the importance of perseverance in the face of challenges.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Damai Dragonboat experience is the spirit of unity
and collective excellence. Each member, whether a paddler, drummer or steersperson,
takes pride in their roles and strives to perform at his best. The CCA's
strength lies in its synchronicity, a harmony that can only be achieved
through consistent training, and demonstrated during intense competitions.
This shared goal bonds the students as they recognise that their success
depends on continued commitment and collaborative effort.</p>
<p>The studentsâ€™ dedication bore fruit in the recent Inter-schools Dragonboat
Competition, with notable achievements across divisions. The B Division
boys' Team A secured sixth place in the Grand Finals, while Team B claimed
third in the minor final, ranking ninth overall in the DB12 category. The
C Division Boys showcased their prowess by clinching first position in
the minor final, placing seventh overall in the category.</p>
<p>As Damai Dragonboat celebrates these accomplishments, the students remain
focused on continuous improvement, aiming to develop both individual skills
and team cohesion as they work towards becoming the best versions of themselves.</p>
