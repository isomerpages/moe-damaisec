<p>As part of the school’s mission to support the holistic development of
students, Ethnic Dance provides students with a platform to discover their
interests and talents. In Ethnic Dance, we aim to instill in students a
sense of graciousness and provide opportunities for students to develop
a lifelong passion for the arts under the guidance of our dedicated and
experienced dance instructor. We hope to nurture our students’ creative
expression, enrich social, cultural and historical awareness, and develop
character and social emotional competencies.</p>
