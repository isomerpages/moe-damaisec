<p>St John cadets undergo at least two levels of&nbsp;<strong>leadership training</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; the Basic and Advanced Non-Commissioned Officers&rsquo; Courses. Through these courses, the cadets not only learn to manage the Corps, but also discover their own strength and leadership potential, and bring home values which will accompany them for the rest of their lives.<br />Interested members pursue instructorship through various programs. In year 2021, three members completed the Basic Drill Instructor Course and two members pursued instructorship through the First Aid Instructor Course.<br />DSS Corps continues to contribute actively to the medical needs of others through their service at school and community events. For a number of years during the Total Defence Day, our SJB members conducted First Aid lessons on Bandaging to other students in the school. In addition, the members also shared their knowledge of the Total Defence GOTC Game Card with the Girl Guides in 2021.</p>
