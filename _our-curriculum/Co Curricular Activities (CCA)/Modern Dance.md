**Annual in-house dance competition and showcase** 

Our dancers get the opportunity to develop bonds while working together choreographing their dance items in groups. This develops their creativity and creates greater awareness of the workings of choreography as they make decisions on song choices, dance movements and attire to ensure coherence of their own items. Beyond that, they are also trained to think about what their dance items are about- the message they are conveying through their dance. This annual showcase cum in-house dance competition is an exciting way to affirm their efforts.
