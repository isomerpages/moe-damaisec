<p>The Damai Choir is dedicated to nurture students with interest and talent in singing. We advocate the joy in singing and strive to boost our students' self-esteem and self-confidence as performers through different available platforms such as the SYF Arts Presentation, Community Programmes and School Concerts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are a big family with a strong emphasis on teamwork - each member is dependent on others to render support to create one harmonious voice. We also believe in instilling in our students a strong sense of responsibility and self-discipline to strive for excellence in the field of music.</p>
