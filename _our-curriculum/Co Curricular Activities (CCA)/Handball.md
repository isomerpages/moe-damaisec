<p><strong>From 2022 onward, Damai Secondary School will no longer be recruiting new players for the handball team.</strong></p>
<p>The Damai Handball team aims to provide all players with competitive opportunities to enhance each player&rsquo;s competence in the sport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camaraderie, teamwork, respect, sportsmanship and a high level of discipline are heavily emphasised during the training sessions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Players are also presented with leadership opportunities to enable them not only to lead their team to victory but also, rise to the occasion during challenging times.</p>
