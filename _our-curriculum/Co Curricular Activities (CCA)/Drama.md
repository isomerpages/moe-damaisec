<p>The Drama Club at Damai inculates a passion for the theatre and provides opportunities for its members to showcase the skills they have acquired. It seeks to create opportunities for social and educational developments through participation in the arts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that drama not only enriches the mind but also, feeds the soul. It allows its practitioners to understand, appreciate, empathise and at the same time, develop a keen sense of acumen that enables them to be discerning consumers of the art forms.</p>
<p>Creativity and uniqueness are celebrated in the Drama Club whilst the nature of the art-form also promotes collaboration and the convergence of ideas and visions.&nbsp;</p>
