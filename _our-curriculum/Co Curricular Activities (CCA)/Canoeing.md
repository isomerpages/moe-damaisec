<p>With teamwork, passion and respect as our guiding motto, the Damai Canoeing
team shows that success isn’t a matter of size — it’s a matter of spirit.
Our canoeists strive for excellence, building strength, character and resilience.</p>
<p>We believe every canoeist has the potential to grow—on the water and beyond.
As teachers, we are committed to working hand‑in‑hand to support each student’s
canoeing journey!</p>
