<p>Girl Guides Singapore is a growing worldwide movement that aims to make the voices of girls and young women around the world heard. Our programme aims to develop young women who have the courage to influence issues that they care for and the boldness to strive to build a better world. We aim to develop our students to become responsible citizens of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Damai, our guides are also involved in service learning programmes at an elderly home, advocacy badge projects, competitions and many more. These experiences teach them valuable life skills such as event planning and team management, leadership and communication skills. We hope for each and every guide under our care to blossom into ladies of strength and confidence.&nbsp;</p>
