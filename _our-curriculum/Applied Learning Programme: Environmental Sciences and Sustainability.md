<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) at Damai Secondary School focuses
on Environmental Sciences and Sustainability, with the objective of raising
students' awareness of major environmental issues and their impacts on
humanity and the planet. The programme hones students' 21<sup>st</sup> century
skills and innovative mindset through hands-on learning experiences and
engagement with technology. By aligning with the Singapore Green Plan 2030
and Eco-Stewardship Programme (ESP), the ALP reinforces the school's commitment
to sustainability education.</p>
<p>To achieve its goals, the ALP adopts the nationwide 4Cs approach: Curriculum,
Campus, Culture and Community. Through the curriculum, environmental topics
are embedded in various subjects, enhancing students’ knowledge and skills
in sustainability. On campus, students are involved in projects that promote
green practices such as waste management and water conservation. The school
culture fosters an environmentally conscious mindset, encouraging students
to engage in eco-friendly practices daily. Finally, through community involvement,
students participate in service learning and advocacy projects, extending
their impact beyond the school.</p>
<p>The desired outcomes of Damai Secondary’s ALP include nurturing a commitment
to advocate for and engage in sustainable living. This is evident through
the school’s environmental education programme, which is seamlessly integrated
into both the academic and co-curricular activities. By engaging in these
initiatives, students develop a deeper understanding of sustainability
and take active steps towards promoting and practising eco-friendly habits.
Damai Secondary School's ALP equips students with essential skills and
values, empowering them to be proactive stewards of the environment. The
programme prepares students for the challenges of the future and instills
in them a sense of duty to contribute positively to society and the planet.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 1</strong>
</p>
<p>Secondary 1 students focus on the sustainable use of water resources.
They learn about global water sources, the impact of human activities on
water and marine ecosystems, and the technologies that enable sustainable
water recycling and reuse. Integrating cross-disciplinary skills, students
use Mathematics to analyse water usage patterns and practise their communication
skills in English and Mother Tongue to advocate for water conservation.
They also take on leadership roles in water conservation through the <em>Kayak n Klean </em>Values
in Action (VIA) activity, where they clean up local waterways. Additionally,
they visit ComCrop, Singapore’s pioneering rooftop urban farm, to observe
innovative technologies being used to optimise land, energy and water usage.
This hands-on experience offers them a deeper insight into environmental
sustainability and the crucial role of urban farming in ensuring food security
for the future.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary 2</strong>
</p>
<p>For Secondary 2 students, the focus shifts to sustainable resource management,
particularly recycling, reusing and upcycling. During ALP lessons, they
embark on a Design Thinking project that encourages them to create solutions
promoting recycling efforts. Students also engage in eco-crafting, teaching
senior citizens to create practical home items from recycled materials
as part of their VIA initiative. Their learning continues in Food and Consumer
Education lessons, where they explore the issues of food waste and ugly
food. To further deepen their understanding, they visit Agritisan at Agape
Village, a local urban farming start-up. Here, they participate in talks
on sustainable food production and green career opportunities, followed
by hands-on planting and harvesting activities. A highlight of the visit
is the Microgreens Workshop, where students cultivate their own crops,
fostering a deeper appreciation for sustainable agriculture.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary 3</strong>
</p>
<p>Secondary 3 students engage in discussions on climate change and the environmental
impact of human activities during English and Mother Tongue lessons, honing
their critical thinking and communication skills. As part of their experiential
learning, they go on a learning journey focusing on composting and ways
to minimise food waste. These activities align with Singapore’s <em>30 by 30</em> initiative,
which aims to meet 30% of the nation’s nutritional needs through local
production by 2030. Such experiences not only expand their scientific knowledge
but also, inspire a lifelong commitment to sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>School Wide Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>As a school, we continue to cultivate a culture of sustainability and
conservation. For Earth Day and World Water Day, the Leaders Council and
the English Department lead various commemorative activities to raise awareness.
Additionally, the school hosted an educational showcase on marine conservation
in October 2024, where students had the opportunity to interact with marine
life, including sea stars and porcupine fish, deepening their understanding
of marine ecosystems.</p>
