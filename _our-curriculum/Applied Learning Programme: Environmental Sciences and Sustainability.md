<p>Damai’s STEM ALP aims to (i) inspire students to go on a journey of self-exploration and self-discovery, (ii) hone students’ 21st century competencies and innovative spirit through authentic learning experiences and tinkering with technology and (iii) strengthen students’ awareness of major environmental issues and their impacts on humanity and Mother Earth. These objectives are encapsulated in the STEM ALP framework below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/Curriculum/ALP/2023_alp_01.png">
<p>To achieve the overarching ALP objectives, the school has developed a unique curriculum that enables students to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage in learning that are relevant, applicable and personal;</li>
<li>Explore the possibilities of learning through a journey of self-exploration and self-discovery;</li>
<li>Experience learning in authentic and real world context.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this 3E approach, the school has developed a unique curriculum which incorporates specific lesson modules on concepts in environmental science and sustainability as well as a design thinking project that provides students the opportunity to embark on an ideation process towards the resolution of an issue related.</p>
<p>All lower secondary students undergo a semester of ALP lessons which incorporate hands-on activities, learning journeys, assembly talks, exhibitions, and workshops to provide varied learning experiences to our students.</p>
<p><b>Tier 1 - Common Curriculum</b><br>
	Sec 1 students participate in the ALP as part of their common curriculum. They gain basic knowledge and skills related to sustainability, focusing on design tasks aligned with the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Students are involved in upcycling projects, including creating informative materials and repurposing used items into new products. </p>
<p><b>Tier 2 - Applied Curriculum</b><br>
Sec 2 students engage in design challenges with practical applications, drawing from their experiences in Values-in-Action (VIAs) and Learning Journeys (LJs) to organizations like URA, LTA, SFA, and the Singapore Sustainable Gallery. The aim is to promote sustainability among their peers. Students also participate in external ALP competitions, and Professional Support Leaders (PSLs) drive recycling efforts.</p>

<p><b>Tier 3 - Interest-based Programme</b><br>
	Sec 3 students with a strong interest in environmental sciences and sustainability, identified based on their performance in Sec 1 and 2 ALP, pursue advanced knowledge and skills in this domain.</p>
<p><b>EPIC STEM Hackathon</b><br>
In 2023, identified secondary three students left a remarkable imprint at the STEM Hackathon, a significant event that marked the commencement of the 3-year EPIC-STEM Programme sponsored by the Temasek Foundation and NIE NTU. Among a cohort of around 130 gifted participants hailing from seven schools in the eastern region, 21 of our students exhibited their exceptional brilliance and innovative prowess. The Hackathon presented them with intricate design challenges to tackle, and three project teams from Damai emerged within the top seven projects, as recognized by the esteemed panel of judges. Although they didn't secure the top positions, our students' unwavering dedication and hard work were highly commendable.</p>

<p>The inaugural launch of the EPIC-STEM programme, initiated through the STEM Hackathon, undeniably offers our students a platform for further exploration and refinement of their STEM talents. Extensive media coverage underscored the event's significance, aligning with Singapore's overarching focus on STEM. As our students engage in this program, they are equipped to embark on a journey of exploration within the realm of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, empowering them to navigate this exciting world of knowledge and innovation.</p>
