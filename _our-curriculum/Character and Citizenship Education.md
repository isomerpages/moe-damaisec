<p><strong>A NURTURING SCHOOL EXPERIENCE THROUGH CHARACTER &amp; CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION</strong>
</p>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), including National Education
(NE), and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), is integral to the holistic
development of our students, leading to positive life outcomes. CCE 2021
provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development
of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions
in a coherent and holistic way. Important aspects of CCE such as National
Education (NE), Sexuality Education (SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education
and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness (CW) and Family Education (FE)
are integrated within a school-wide approach. It is essential for students
to internalise the necessary values, attitudes and competencies to become
self-directed learners, confident people, active contributors and concerned
citizens, which are the desired outcomes of education.</p>
<p>The school provides rich learning platforms and opportunities for students
to be equipped with knowledge, moral and civic values, skills and dispositions
to understand who they are and who they can become. Through a variety of
learning activities within and beyond the classroom, students experience
being part of something larger than themselves and become cognizant of
their roles and responsibilities in their families, communities, the nation,
and beyond.</p>
<p>3 overarching big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices are the
core concepts in these lessons to enable students to develop key understanding
of the issues:</p>

<p><strong>National Education Events @ Damai</strong>
</p>
<p>National Education inculcates values in students and a sense of appreciation
and belonging to the nation. Damai Secondary School seeks to create an
experiential learning for students to cultivate emotional rootedness and
active citizenry in Singapore through the four NE commemorative events
– Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and
National Day. These events are important reminders of our identity as Singaporeans.

<p><strong>Sexuality Education @ Damai</strong>
</p>
<p>Sexuality Education in schools is about enabling students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with
members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Education @ Damai</strong>
</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness refers to the positive well-being of internet users.&nbsp;
It involves an understanding of the norms of appropriate, responsible behaviour
with regard to technology use as well as knowledge, skills, values and
attitudes on how to protect oneself and other internet users in the cyber
world.&nbsp; It looks into the positive physical and psychosocial well-being
of students in their use of mobile and internet technologies. Cyber Wellness
is, hence, important as it looks into the positive well-being of students
as they navigate the cyberspace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Family Education @ Damai</strong>
</p>
<p>The family provides the first experience of love, care, and emotional
support. The family is also the key influencer in helping our children
make sense of their experiences in life. Family education will explicitly
inculcate four family values – love, commitment, respect and care and concern.</p>
