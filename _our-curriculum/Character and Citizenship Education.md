<p><strong>A Nurturing School Experience through Character &amp; Citizenship Education</strong></p>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), including National Education (NE), and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), are integral to the holistic development of our students, leading to positive life outcomes. CCE 2021 provides an integrated approach to addressing our students&rsquo; development of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions in a coherent and holistic way. Important aspects of CCE, such as National Education (NE), Sexuality Education (SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness (CW), and Family Education (FE), are integrated within a school-wide approach. This is essential for students to internalize the necessary values, attitudes, and competencies to become self-directed learners, confident people, active contributors, and concerned citizens, which are the desired outcomes of education.</p>
<p>The school provides rich learning platforms and opportunities for students to be equipped with the knowledge, moral and civic values, skills and dispositions to understand who they are and who they can become. Through a variety of learning activities within and beyond the classroom, students experience being part of something larger than themselves and become cognizant of their roles and responsibilities in their families, communities, the nation, and beyond.</p>
<p>3 overarching big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices are the core concepts in these lessons to enable students to develop key understanding of the issues.</p>

<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Education @ Damai</strong></p>
<p>Cyber Wellness refers to the positive well-being of internet users. It involves an understanding of the norms of appropriate, responsible behaviour with regard to technology use as well as knowledge, skills, values and attitudes on how to protect oneself and other internet users in the cyber world. It looks into the positive physical and psychosocial well-being of students in their use of mobile and internet technologies. Cyber Wellness is hence, important as it looks into the positive well-being of students as they navigate the cyberspace.</p>
<p><strong>Family Education @ Damai</strong></p>
<p>The family provides the first experience of love, care, and emotional support. The family is also the key influencer in helping our children make sense of their experiences in life. Family education will explicitly inculcate four family values &ndash; love, commitment, respect and care and concern.&nbsp;</p>
