<p><strong><u>Department Focus</u></strong>
</p>
<p>“Every child is a self-directed learner and creative problem solver.”
<br>&nbsp;– Vision of Mathematics department.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;a department, we work towards enabling our students to apply mathematical
concepts and skills in their daily lives. As such, we aim to develop our
students to be effective and confident problem solvers and equip them with
the ability to think critically.</p>
<p>They will be able to communicate their ideas and thoughts using appropriate
mathematical concepts. In addition, they will possess mathematical process
skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subjects under Mathematics department: Mathematics, Principles of Accounts
(POA), Computer Applications (CPA) and Retail Operations (RO).</p>
<p><strong><u>Curriculum</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p>The department believes strongly in building a strong foundation in the
subject as well as providing an enriching and engaging learning experience
for our students in the classrooms. This is done through the use of various
teaching and learning approaches including collaborative learning, self-directed
learning and ICT-infused teaching and learning.</p>
<p>With every student owning a personal learning device now, the teachers
in the department design ICT-enriched learning experiences for all the
students so that they can use these digital resources to learn according
to their needs and interests, and collaborate with one another, anytime
and anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The department’s assessment approaches include Assessment for Learning
(AfL) and Assessment of Learning (AoL). These include pen and paper assessments,
chapter graded assignments, performance tasks, on-line assessments, reflection
journals and projects.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Accounts (POA)</strong>
</p>
<p>The subject POA is offered as an elective subject for the upper secondary
Express and Normal (Academic) courses. Students offering POA are introduced
to the principles and concepts of accounting and their applications in
a variety of business situations. In the process, students will develop
an understanding of the importance of professional ethics.</p>
<p>The POA unit’s teaching and learning approach is to help students construct
their POA knowledge by building upon their pre-existing knowledge and experiences.
This is done through the use of examples and experiences that students
can easily relate to, and through the use of newspaper articles when real-life
examples are available. Whenever possible, connections to learning from
previous topics are made to help students see the links between the different
topics in the syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Computer Applications (CPA)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CPA lower secondary syllabus focuses on equipping students with fundamental
ICT skills that will support the learning of other Normal (Technical) subjects
and are useful in their personal lives. At the upper secondary levels,
the syllabus focuses on higher-order thinking skills. Students taking CPA
will learn problem solving skills and basic programming concepts and skills.
Basic programming concepts and skills will be learnt through simple animation
and game design, and eventually, applied to solve problems in everyday
contexts. This serves to better prepare students for further studies in
programming and media-related courses as well as for the work place and
future learning. There are six compulsory modules in the subject. These
modules are: (1) Computer Fundamentals, (2) Media Elements, (3) Document
Processing, (4) Spreadsheets, (5) Multimedia Communication, and (6) Media
Computing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CPA unit’s teaching and learning approach serves to promote self-directed
learning in our students through the use of instructional videos during
lessons. Besides using pen and paper mode of assessment, the teachers use
ICT tools to make assessment fun, engaging and meaningful to our students.</p>
<p><strong>Retail Operations (RO)</strong>
</p>
<p>Over a two-year period, Secondary 3 and 4 students in the Normal (Technical)
course will learn how to promote a retail store’s products, manage its
inventory and serve customers. During this period of time, there is hands-on
learning where students are exposed to the world of retailing through practical
and theory lessons in a simulated retail setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retailing skills such as handling and displaying merchandise, managing
inventory levels, performing housekeeping duties and interacting with customers
are emphasised. On top of these, the curriculum also calls for soft skills
to be taught. Aside from learning how to effectively engage a customer,
the importance of teamwork and being professional when a customer is angry
or frustrated is also highlighted in lessons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self-directed learning is another characteristic of the syllabus where
students would need to independently research for their practical assessments
and presentations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the learning objectives of the subject encapsulate the
basic retailing skills needed for students to better appreciate and understand
the industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Signature Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As a department, we have organised various signature programmes to engage
our students at the different academic levels. This is to make learning
of Mathematics fun and engaging so that students can apply the mathematical
concepts and skills learnt during curriculum lessons beyond the classroom,
into their everyday lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some examples include the annual Mathematics Assembly Programme. In this
programme, we organise various activities to engage the students. The students
from different courses come together and work as a team to solve the different
quizzes and questions related to Mathematics and Principle of Accounts.
As a result, all the students always enjoy themselves and have fun with
their classmates during the programme.</p>
<p>In class, we adopt different modes of teaching to suit students of different
readiness and interests. For example, we adopt Differential Instruction
during lesson times so that all the students can benefit from the differentiated
scaffolding and support provided to them.</p>
