<p><strong><u>Department Focus</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In Damai Secondary School, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) teachers
adopt various teaching pedagogies and infuse ICT components into daily
MTL lessons. In addition, teachers leverage on Differentiated Instruction
(DI) strategies to support students in their learning. The department strives

their horizons and enable them to tap into opportunities in the regional
and global environment in the future. The MTL department seeks to adopt
innovative teaching and learning strategies to build a solid foundation
for students in learning MTL as well as cultivate a strong interest in
their respective Mother Tongue languages and cultures.</p>
