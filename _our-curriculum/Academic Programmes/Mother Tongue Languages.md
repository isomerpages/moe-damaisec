content through class discussions, online games and a variety of interactive
activities, creating an engaging and enriching reading experience. Students
also took part in a reading competition at the end of the programme, applying
their understanding of the book in a fun and challenging way.</p>

<p><strong><u>Highlights of 2025</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Indonesia Bina Bangsa School 培民学校 Educational Visit 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>This year, Damai Secondary School had the pleasure of hosting teachers
from Bina Bangsa School for an educational visit and teaching pedagogy
exchange. The session provided a valuable platform for both schools to
share insights on effective teaching practices and classroom strategies.
The visit not only deepened professional understanding but also, strengthened
collaboration among educators across different educational contexts. It
was a meaningful opportunity to celebrate the spirit of lifelong learning
and build connections which inspire continued growth in teaching and learning.</p>

<p><strong>Suzhou Immersion Programme 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>From 1 to 6 June 2025, a group of secondary three students took part in
the China Immersion Programme to Suzhou and Shanghai for a six-day educational
and cultural experience. Students had the opportunity to attend Xinghai
Experimental School in Suzhou, where they joined in lessons alongside their
local buddies, gaining first-hand insights into China’s education system
and forming meaningful cross-cultural friendships.</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, students visited Suzhou’s Tongli Ancient Town and
the Silk Museum, learning about the city’s rich heritage, before heading
to Shanghai’s Oriental Pearl Tower to witness the blend of tradition and
modernity. Through exploring cultural landmarks, tasting local delicacies
and participating in tea appreciation, students developed greater cultural
awareness, independence and teamwork. The trip was a memorable journey
of discovery, connection and growth.</p>
