<p><strong>Reading Programmes<br></strong>This year, Damai Secondary School
participated in the Reading Ambassadors’ Programme, organised by the department
to promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL). The programme supports the
school in fostering a strong Chinese reading culture through curated book
collections and meaningful reading activities both in and beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>As part of our Reading Programme, the selected secondary one class was
assigned one book to read for the year. Teachers reinforced the book’s
content through class discussions, online games and a variety of interactive
activities, creating an engaging and enriching reading experience. Students
also took part in a reading competition at the end of the programme, applying
their understanding of the book in a fun and challenging way.</p>
