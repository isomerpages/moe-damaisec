<p><strong><u>Department Focus</u></strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;Physical Education (PE) department aims to inculcate the joy of physical activity in our students. The PE programmes provide students with hands-on experiences to learn a variety of sports and games, deepen their understanding of physical health and fitness, and develop an appreciation of the outdoors.</p>
<p><strong><u>Curriculum</u></strong></p>
<p>Students&nbsp;will be assessed for their learning through a combination of practical as well as theory tests. These assessments are based on the various sports and games modules. Sec 2 and Sec 4 students will also undergo the National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) Tests.</p>
