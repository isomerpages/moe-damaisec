<p><strong><u>Curriculum<br></u></strong>The syllabus of the secondary school
science education in Singapore is based on the Science Curriculum Framework
of the Ministry of Education, Singapore. It emphasises the need for a balance
between the acquisition of Core Ideas, Practices, and Values, Ethics and
Attitudes in Science. In addition, as and when the topics lend themselves,
the technological applications, social implications and the value aspects
of Science are also considered. It also emphasises the broad coverage of
fundamental concepts in the natural and physical world.</p>

<h6>Our Science Curriculum Framework serves as the cornerstone of science education in Singapore, designed to equip our students with a robust foundation in Science for life and society. This framework revolves around three guiding principles, collectively known as the "INs" – inspire, inquire, and innovate, shaping the holistic educational experience we aim to offer our students.</h6>
<p>The outer circle of this framework symbolises the critical components
that constitute the bedrock of a comprehensive science education: Core
Ideas, Practices, and Values, Ethics, and Attitudes.</p>
<p>Within this framework, the pair of hands metaphorically represents the
dynamic roles our students assume as inquisitive learners, actively engaging
in their scientific pursuits. They receive unwavering support from our
dedicated educators and collaborative partners who serve as proficient
facilitators, imparting both the thrill and the intrinsic value of scientific
knowledge to our students. This partnership in the realm of learning and
teaching extends beyond the boundaries of the classroom to include various
stakeholders. Together, we collectively nurture and fuel our students'
sense of curiosity and innovation, inspire their intellectual growth, and
foster a deep appreciation for the practical applications of science into
their daily lives, society, and the broader environment.</p>

<p><strong><u>Signature Programmes<br></u></strong>At Damai Secondary School,
our Science Department is dedicated to delivering authentic and engaging
lessons that are both meaningful and relevant to students' daily lives.
We aim to develop students' confidence and competencies in science through
a curriculum that includes inquiry-based lessons, practical sessions and
experiential learning opportunities. Our vision is to empower students
with a strong foundation in science, equipping them to lead purposeful
and informed lives.</p>
<p>Recently, our Secondary 1 and 2 students embarked on enriching learning
journeys that explored the essential role of sustainable agriculture. Secondary
1 students visited ComCrop, Singapore's first rooftop urban farm, where
they witnessed the innovative use of technology to optimise land, energy,
and water efficiency. During the guided tour, students explored production
rooms, nurseries, and packaging facilities while engaging in discussions
on the importance of sustainable farming for Singapore’s future. This hands-on
experience not only deepened their understanding of environmental sustainability
but also, emphasised the critical role urban farming plays in ensuring
food security.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our Secondary 2 students visited Agritisan at Agape Village,
a local start-up focused on agricultural education and urban farming. They
attended engaging talks on food sustainability and green careers, which
provided insights into the opportunities and importance of sustainability-related
fields. Students also participated in hands-on harvesting and planting
activities at the rooftop farm, allowing them to experience urban agriculture
first-hand. A highlight of their visit was the Microgreens Workshop, where
they nurtured their own crops and gained a deeper appreciation of the agricultural
process.</p>
