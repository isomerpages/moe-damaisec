<p><strong><u>Curriculum<br></u></strong>The syllabus of secondary school science education in Singapore is based on the Science Curriculum Framework of the Ministry of Education, Singapore. It emphasises the need for a balance between the acquisition of Core Ideas, Practices, and Values, Ethics and Attitudes in Science. In addition, as and when the topics lend themselves, the technological applications, social implications and the value aspects of Science are also considered. It also emphasises the broad coverage of fundamental concepts in the natural and physical world.</p>

<p>Our Science Curriculum Framework serves as the cornerstone of science education in Singapore, designed to equip our students with a robust foundation in Science for Life and Society. This framework revolves around the three guiding principles, collectively known as the "INs" – inspire, inquire, and innovate, shaping the holistic educational experience we aim to provide to our students.</p>
<p>
The outer circle of this framework symbolizes the critical components that constitute the bedrock of a comprehensive science education: Core Ideas, Practices, and Values, Ethics, and Attitudes.</p>
<p>
Within this framework, the pair of hands metaphorically represents the dynamic roles our students assume as inquisitive learners, actively engaging in their scientific pursuits. They receive unwavering support from our dedicated educators and collaborative partners who serve as proficient facilitators, imparting both the thrill and the intrinsic value of scientific knowledge to our students. This partnership in the realm of learning and teaching extends beyond the boundaries of the classroom to include various stakeholders. Together, we collectively nurture and fuel our students' sense of curiosity and innovation, inspire their intellectual growth, and foster a deep appreciation for the practical applications of science in their daily lives, society, and the broader environment.

<p><strong><u>Signature Programmes<br></u></strong>Damai Secondary believes in making science come alive through authentic learning experiences and learning journeys.</p>
<img src="/images/Curriculum/Science/2023_science_01.png">
	
<p>Our Secondary One and Two students embarked on captivating Science Learning Journeys that provided immersive experiences, enhancing their scientific knowledge and fostering a deeper understanding of sustainability.</p>
	<p>
In the heart of our city, the Secondary One students explored a hidden gem—an edible garden. Here, they delved into the world of vermicomposting, observing the remarkable transformation of food waste into nutrient-rich compost. A captivating sensory garden tour introduced them to the wonders of diverse plant life, while uncovering the secrets behind the health benefits of microgreens added an extra layer of fascination.</p>
<img src="/images/Curriculum/Science/2023_science_02.png">
<p>The Secondary Two students ventured into the world of Agritisan, a local startup dedicated to agricultural education and urban farming. Engaging discussions on food sustainability and green job prospects broadened their horizons. They actively participated in a rooftop urban farm tour, engaging in the fulfilling tasks of harvesting and seeding. Furthermore, an enlightening eco-enzymes workshop empowered them to craft their own eco-enzymes from food waste, utilizing citrus peels.</p>
<p>These enlightening learning journeys nurtured our students' scientific acumen, cultivating a deep-rooted understanding of sustainable practices and the significance of urban farming. Through these hands-on experiences, our students have developed a newfound appreciation for the intricate interplay between science and the world in which they live.
