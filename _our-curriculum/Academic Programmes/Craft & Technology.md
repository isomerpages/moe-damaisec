<p><strong><u>Department Focus</u></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE)<br></strong>The FCE syllabus is experiential in nature with hands-on activities in an authentic learning context. This syllabus allows students to acquire knowledge and develop skills which is aligned with the 21st Century Competencies. Inquiry based learning strategies such as Socratic questioning, mindmapping, games and collaborative learning, are used to facilitate the inquiry processes.</p>
<p><strong>Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T)<br></strong>Students&nbsp;learn through design-and-make projects to develop design thinking and doing&nbsp;to visualise and concretise design solutions for real-world contexts. It involves using&nbsp;sketching and drawing to conceptualise design solutions, creating and developing mock-ups&nbsp;to evaluate ideas and constructing a prototype of the design solution. Students will be immersed in the design process which requires them to apply basic design and technology knowledge and design thinking skills.</p>
<p><strong>Art &amp; Music<br></strong>The&nbsp;roles art and music play in our students’ growth and development cannot be overstated. Through positive learning experiences in art and music, students develop skills which enable them to observe and perceive the world with increased awareness and sensitivity. Also, creating art pieces and engaging in music encourage the development of creativity and engender a sense of self-worth. In this way, students are better equipped to understand and engage with the world they live in. With this in mind, the department aims to develop creative students with sound moral values as they discover themselves, their interests and talents through their experimentation in Visual Art and Music.</p>
<p><u><strong>Curriculum<br></strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE) / Food &amp; Nutrition (F&amp;N) / Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS)<br></strong>The Lower Secondary FCE syllabus provides opportunities for students to gain the knowledge in diet and health and how to manage resources in order to make healthier food choices. This is in view of the emerging food and health trend in Singapore. To enhance their learning, all students will carry out a project work and through this project, they will learn basic investigative work in order to create the best product for the task.</p>
<p>As they progress to Upper Secondary, they will learn in depth the concepts of nutrition and experimental investigation. Through this learning, we hope that students will lead a healthier life style, be more discerning in making appropriate food choices and apply principles of culinary science in food preparation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Design and Technology (D&amp;T)<br></strong>The&nbsp;lower secondary D&amp;T syllabus focuses on the development of freehand sketching through idea generation and development. The lower secondary D&amp;T syllabus also offers tactile learning experiences for the students to construct prototypes of the developed ideas.</p>
<p>In Secondary One, students carry out simple research, learn how to 'sketch to conceptualise design' and ‘create mock-ups to test design’ to construct one prototype from metal and plastics.</p>
<p>In Secondary Two, students carry out more in-depth research, apply the methods of 'sketch to conceptualise design' and ‘develop mock-ups to evaluate design' learnt in Secondary One to construct one prototype made from wood and plastics.</p>
<p>In upper secondary, students will undertake design projects ranging from project tasks with a common design brief, to seeking their own design opportunities that are authentic and meaningful from the given themes. They also acquire working knowledge of Technology (Material, Workshop Processes, Structures, Mechanisms and Electronics)</p>
<p><strong>Art<br></strong>The&nbsp;objectives of the Lower Secondary Art syllabus are achieved through the framework of Seeing, Expressing and Appreciating. The three behavioural domains of seeing, expressing and appreciating take into consideration the cognitive, affective and psychomotor dimensions in which students are involved when they are learning art. The framework ensures that students are provided with opportunities to observe their environment, generate ideas, create artworks, discuss art and value the role of art in society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;framework for the Upper Secondary Art syllabus is structured under three learning domains of Perceiving, Communicating and Appreciating. These learning domains take into consideration the cognitive, psychomotor and affective dimensions in which students are involved when they are engaged in the visual arts. The three domains are inter-connected and operate dynamically.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary General Music Programme<br></strong>The&nbsp;General Music Programme (GMP) is offered to all lower secondary students. It is a key platform upon which every child is provided with a basic music education, giving them opportunities to develop a connection to music. This contributes to the future development and preservation of Singapore’s cultural heritage. Music, being an integral part of many cultures, also provides a means to raise global awareness amongst students. The processes involved in music performing and creating develop skills such as listening skills, fine motor skills, creative thinking skills and social skills. Music enables students to express their thoughts and ideas. The aims of the GMP are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Develop awareness and appreciation of music in local and global cultures</li>
<li>Develop ability for creative expression and communication through music</li>
<li>Provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
