<p><strong><u>Department Focus</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At Damai Secondary School, the Craft &amp; Technology Department is dedicated
to nurturing students’ passions and talents through a holistic approach
to education. We inspire our students to explore their interests in Music,
Art, Design and Technology (D&amp;T), and Nutrition and Food Science (NFS),
empowering them to embrace authentic learning experiences that foster creativity
and critical thinking.</p>
<p>Our mission is to equip students with the skills needed to address real-world
challenges. By promoting a deep appreciation for aesthetics, innovative
solutions, and healthy lifestyle choices, we prepare our students to lead
purposeful and meaningful lives, enabling our students to thrive in an
ever-evolving world.</p>
<p><strong>Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T)<br></strong>Students&nbsp;learn
through design-and-make projects to develop design thinking and doing&nbsp;to
visualise and concretise design solutions for real-world contexts. It involves
using&nbsp;sketching and drawing to conceptualise design solutions, creating
and developing mock-ups&nbsp;to evaluate ideas and constructing a prototype
of the design solution. Students will be immersed in the design process
which requires them to apply basic design and technology knowledge and
design thinking skills.</p>
<p><strong>Art &amp; Music<br></strong>The&nbsp;roles art and music play
in our students’ growth and development cannot be overstated. Through positive
learning experiences in art and music, students develop skills which enable
them to observe and perceive the world with increased awareness and sensitivity.
Also, creating art pieces and engaging in music encourage the development
of creativity and engender a sense of self-worth. In this way, students
are better equipped to understand and engage with the world they live in.
With this in mind, the department aims to develop creative students with
sound moral values as they discover themselves, their interests and talents
through their experimentation in Visual Art and Music.</p>
<p><strong><u>Curriculum<br></u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE) / Food &amp; Nutrition (F&amp;N) / Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS)<br></strong>The
Lower Secondary FCE syllabus provides opportunities for students to gain
the knowledge in diet and health and how to manage resources in order to
make healthier food choices. This is in view of the emerging food and health
trend in Singapore. To enhance their learning, all students will carry
out a project work and through this project, they will learn basic investigative
work in order to create the best product for the task.</p>
<p>As they progress to Upper Secondary, they will learn in depth the concepts
of nutrition and experimental investigation. Through this learning, we
hope that students will lead a healthier life style, be more discerning
in making appropriate food choices and apply principles of culinary science
in food preparation.&nbsp;</p>
