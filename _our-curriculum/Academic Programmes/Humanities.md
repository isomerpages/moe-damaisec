<p><strong>üìòCurriculum &amp; Syllabus Links</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The Geography Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary: </strong>Focuses on the theme of ‚Äúinteraction‚Äù,
examining how humans and the environment influence each other. Students
explore how population growth drives resource use, the need for sustainable
resource management, and how physical environments are modified for living
spaces, including the challenges that result. Through inquiry-based learning,
students develop critical thinking and investigative skills, preparing
them to understand and address geographical issues in a rapidly changing
world.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary: </strong>Provides students with an in-depth understanding
of human and physical environments, focusing on sustainable development
and spatial analysis. Students study geographical methods, tourism, and
plate tectonics, exploring how human activities interact with the natural
world and the impacts of these interactions. Through investigations, case
studies, and fieldwork, students develop critical thinking, analytical
skills, and a sense of responsibility as informed, environmentally-aware
citizens.</p>

<p><strong>The History Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary: </strong>Explores historical issues through the
theme of ‚Äúrootedness‚Äù, helping students understand Singapore‚Äôs origins,
its regional and global connections, and its development from the 1400s
to 2000s. Students explore Singapore‚Äôs history within the context of shifting
political statuses, such as the Melaka Sultanate, the British and Japanese
empires, and how Singapore adapted to regional and global contexts. Through
historical inquiry, students appreciate the complexities of the past and
develop critical thinking skills to understand the present.</p>

</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary: </strong>Focuses on International History under
the theme ‚Äúchange and managing change‚Äù, examining key events, ideas, and
forces from 1918‚Äì1989 that shaped the modern world. Students study the
theme <em>The Making of the 20th Century Modern World (1910s‚Äì1991)</em>,
focusing on significant events such as the rise of authoritarian regimes,
World War II, and the Cold War. Through historical inquiry, students gain
insights into the complexities of the past and its impact on the present,
developing skills to analyse, evaluate, and communicate historical knowledge
effectively.</p>

<p><strong>G1 Humanities</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The G1 Humanities programme at Damai Secondary integrates Social Studies
with three Humanities Exposure Modules (HEMs) in Geography, History, and
Literature in English. These modules are designed as bite-sized units to
ignite students' curiosity and appreciation for the humanities, helping
them understand people's relationships with self, society, and the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At Upper Secondary, the students will have a focused study on societal
and geographical issues on sustainability and care for society.</p>

<p>üí° <strong>Our Assessment Approach:</strong>
</p>
<p>We use a balanced approach to assessment, combining <strong>Assessment for Learning (AfL)</strong> and <strong>Assessment of Learning (AoL)</strong>.
This helps students take ownership of their learning while progressively
developing their skills and knowledge.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Constructive Feedback</strong> ‚Äì Students receive timely, actionable
feedback to guide improvement and growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Assessment Opportunities</strong> ‚Äì Students reflect on their
own learning to identify strengths and areas to improve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diverse Assessment Modes</strong> ‚Äì Students are assessed through
Geographical and Historical investigations, source-based questions, short
answer questions, and structured questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Individual and Group Tasks</strong> ‚Äì Students engage in both formal
and alternative assessments, promoting collaboration as well as independent
thinking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach ensures that assessment is not just a measure of performance
but a tool to enhance learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving
skills in Humanities.</p>
