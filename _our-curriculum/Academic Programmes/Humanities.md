<p><strong><u>Department Focus</u></strong></p>
<p>The Humanities, comprising Geography, History and Social Studies, provides multiple lenses to help students understand the world we live in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Damai Humanities students will be:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Keenly aware of global issues.</li>
<li>Critical thinkers who understand the human condition, environment and global issues.</li>
<li>Effective and eloquent communicators with a personal voice.</li>
<li>Empathetic towards others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Curriculum<br /></u></strong><strong>Pedagogy<br /></strong><u></u>Integral to the study of humanities is inquiry-based learning as its main pedagogical approach, to encourage critical thinking, investigation and problem solving in the exploration of issues. Students would be equipped with 21st Century skills to become independent learners. Sociological, Geographical and Historical investigations through field-based and experiential learning offer opportunities for students to engage in the inquiry process.</p>
<p><strong>The Geography Curriculum<br /></strong>The Geography syllabus adopts a thematic and issue-based framework. In the lower secondary syllabus, students explore geographical issues through the theme of &ldquo;interaction&rdquo;, using geographical lens to understand the interaction between human and the environment. Students will learn how population drives resource consumption and the need for resource management, as well as understand how physical environments are altered to create living spaces and its resultant issues. Students in the upper secondary syllabus explore issues through the theme of &ldquo;change and managing change&rdquo;, understanding and examining relevant and current issues due to changes in the physical world and human world. Students will appreciate the complexity and dynamism behind the changes, and the multiple perspectives in change management.</p>
<p><strong>The History Curriculum<br /></strong>The&nbsp;History syllabus adopts a thematic and issues-based framework. In the Lower Secondary syllabus, students explore historical issues through the theme of &ldquo;rootedness&rdquo;, using historical lens to understand the origin of Singapore, its connections with Asia and the world, its development and challenges within the timeframe of 1400s to 2000s. Students in the Upper Secondary syllabus explore issues in International History through the theme of &ldquo;change and managing change&rdquo;, understanding and examining key events, ideas and forces that shaped the world today from 1918-1989.</p>
<p><strong>The Social Studies Curriculum<br /></strong>The&nbsp;Upper Secondary Social Studies syllabus explores societal issues that shape and impact Singapore society and the world. Anchored on three central themes of Citizenship and Governance, Living in a Diverse Society and Being Part of a Globalised world, students engage with current global issues and develop competencies to be informed, concerned and participative citizens through active class discussion and sociological inquiry. Social Studies emphasises on knowledge beyond factual recall, analyse different points of view, the ability to construct reasoned arguments and make informed judgement and recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><u>Syllabus Links<br /></u></strong>Assessment in the Damai Humanities curriculum include Assessment for Learning (AfL) and Assessment of Learning (AoL) to encourage ownership of learning and the progressive development of skills and knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The department's Assessment for Learning (AfL) strategies are focussed on:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing effective feedback to students that is both constructive and developmental.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Empowering students by providing opportunities for self-assessment.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Modes of assessment include Geographical and Historical investigation, source-based questions, short answer questions and structured questions. Students will be provided opportunities to engage in formal and alternative assessment tasks at both individual and group levels.</p>

<p><strong>Overseas Learning Journey to Vietnam<br /></strong>At&nbsp;Damai Secondary School, all students will be given opportunities to participate in overseas learning journeys. We believe that these overseas trips prepare our students to be future-ready by providing them with an ideal platform to develop their global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Humanities Department organises a biennial trip to Vietnam to learn more about its history, explore its geographical wonders and appreciate its diverse cultural heritage. Its natural geographical wonders of Halong Bay and urban farming methods are a rare sight for our students. The well-preserved historical and heritage sites in the country speak of the complexities involved of the evolution of the country from a French colony to a contemporary Communist state at the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum. Students also have a chance to explore the ethnography of Vietnam and interact with people living with the effects of Agent Orange. Students also interact and learn more about Vietnamese culture by interacting and visiting our Vietnamese partner schools in Hanoi.</p>
