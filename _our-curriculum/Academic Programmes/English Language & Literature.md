<p><strong><u>Department Focus</u></strong></p>

<p>The incorporation of authentic resources, performance tasks and novel activities such as choral reading, poetry-writing, dramatisation into our curriculum highlights our deep commitment to raise our students’ attainment level and make learning a joy for them. </p>

<p><strong><u>Highlights</u></strong></p>
  

**National Schools Literature Festival**

<p>The National Schools Literature Festival is the biggest literary programme organised for students in Singapore. Held annually, the festival has provided opportunities for students to share their passion and love for Literature through inter-school competitions such as debates, choral reading and book trailers. In this festival, our students’ passion certainly shines through as they light up the festival with their moving literary interpretations and performances. Our achievements include clinching a bronze award in the Choral Reading category and champion award in the Debate category. </p>

**Learning Journeys and In-House Workshops**

Learning journeys to watch performances are organised to expose students to different literary forms. To build students’ confidence and mastery of the language, Public Speaking workshops are conducted for the lower secondary.
