<p><strong><u>Department Focus</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At the core of the English Department is our commitment to nurturing articulate,
thoughtful, and empathetic individuals. Through the study of English Language
and English Literature, we empower students to develop a deep appreciation
for language as a tool for communication, inquiry, and reflection.</p>
<p>Through the English Language curriculum, we aim to nurture students who
are empathetic communicators, able to express themselves clearly and respectfully,
with sensitivity to diverse audiences. We also seek to cultivate discerning
readers who are adept at critically evaluating and interpreting a wide
range of texts with insight and depth. At the same time, we encourage students
to be creative inquirers: curious, imaginative thinkers who approach ideas
with confidence and a spirit of innovation.</p>
<p>Through the study of English Literature, we deepen students’ understanding
of the human condition by engaging them with texts that explore timeless
personal and societal themes. Literature offers a lens to appreciate diverse
perspectives and the richness of cultural, historical, and social contexts.
Our curriculum fosters empathy, global awareness, and a sensitivity to
the power of language in shaping meaning and emotion. Students develop
reflective habits of mind, learning to embrace complexity, consider multiple
interpretations, and construct well-reasoned, evidence-based analyses of
texts.</p>
<p><strong><u>Curriculum</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>English Language</strong>
</p>
<p>Our English Language curriculum is designed to build students’ confidence
and competence across the four key domains of communication: reading, writing,
speaking and listening. Through engagement with a diverse range of authentic
and literary texts, students develop critical literacy, analytical reasoning
and expressive clarity.</p>
<p>Lessons are structured to foster creativity, encourage collaboration and
develop independent thought. Students gain a strong foundation in grammar
and vocabulary while learning to adapt their communication for different
purposes and audiences. The curriculum equips them with the skills to thrive
in both academic settings and real-world interactions.</p>
<p><strong>English Literature</strong>
</p>
<p>The English Literature curriculum offers students a rich and immersive
experience with texts from various genres, cultures, and historical periods.
Through the close study of poetry, prose, and drama, students sharpen their
interpretive and analytical skills while deepening their understanding
of the human condition.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to engage personally and intellectually with texts,
exploring themes, character development, and stylistic techniques. Discussion,
debate and creative response tasks promote empathy, imagination, and a
deeper awareness of social and moral complexities. Ultimately, the curriculum
fosters a lifelong appreciation of literature as both art and inquiry</p>
<p><strong><u>Assessment</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To foster student engagement and ownership of learning, and obtain a snapshot
of student achievement, the department integrates both Assessment for Learning
and Assessment of Learning into its evaluative framework.</p>
