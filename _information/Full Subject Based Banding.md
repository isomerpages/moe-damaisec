<p>Damai Secondary School is one of 30+ secondary schools which has implemented
Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) since 2022.</p>
<p>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)&nbsp;is part of MOE's ongoing efforts
to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to
the different strengths and interests of our students.</p>

<p><strong><em>What Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) looks like in Damai Secondary</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><em>Mixed form classes from Secondary One</em></strong><em><br>All </em><strong><em>Secondary 1 students are placed in mixed classes</em></strong><em> where they learn and grow alongside peers with different strengths, interests, and learning profiles.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>A shared core curriculum for all</em></strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>All Sec 1 and Sec 2 students will learn a </em><strong><em>common set of subjects together</em></strong><em> in their form classes. These subjects allow every student to experience broad learning opportunities and develop essential life skills. These include Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), Art, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Music &amp; Physical Education.</em>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><em>Greater flexibility in subject levels</em></strong><em><br>Under FSBB, Subject-Based Banding is expanded beyond the four PSLE core subjects.<br>This means eligible G1 and G2 students may take certain subjects—such as </em><strong><em>Humanities—at a more demanding level from Secondary 2 onwards</em></strong><em>, based on their strengths and readiness</em>

<p><strong>Offering subjects at a more demanding level</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>At the start of Secondary One</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Eligible students can offer&nbsp;<strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science</strong>&nbsp;at
a more demanding level based on their PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each
of these subjects.</p>

<p><strong><em>Beyond the start of Secondary One</em></strong>
</p>
<p>From Secondary 2 (S2), students will also be able to offer&nbsp;<strong>Humanities subjects</strong>&nbsp;(Geography,
History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level. The criteria
for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students'
aptitude for and interest in these subjects at S1.</p>

<p><strong>Offering subjects at a Less Demanding Level</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>At the start of Secondary One</em></strong>
</p>
<p>For students who offered English, Mathematics and/or Science at Foundation
level at PSLE, but are otherwise eligible to take most of their subjects
at G3 when entering secondary school, they may choose to take these subjects
at a less demanding level (i.e., G2), in consultation with their secondary
schools.</p>
<p>Students who face exceptional difficulties coping with their Mother Tongue
Languages (MTL) will have the option to offer G1 or G2 MTL. At the start
of Secondary One, students can offer MTL at a less demanding level based
on the following criteria:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="SBB Eligibility 2" src="/images/Information/SBB/SBB03.jpg">
</div>
<p><strong><em>Beyond the start of Secondary One</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Students may offer subjects at a less demanding level, based on their
performance and schools’ holistic assessment, to calibrate their academic
load.</p>
<p>Schools will also have the discretion to allow students with difficulties
coping with MTL to offer MTL at a less demanding level, based on holistic
considerations.</p>
<p>Students who offer subjects at a less demanding level may subsequently
offer the subjects at a more demanding level as they gain greater competence
and confidence in the subjects.</p>
<p>The increased flexibility empowers students to take greater ownership
of their learning according to their subject-specific strengths and interests.</p>
<p><strong><em>New Grading Scheme for Examinable Common Curriculum Subjects</em></strong>
</p>
<p>With effect from 2025, a new grading scheme will be implemented for examinable
common curriculum subjects at lower secondary level. These subjects are
Art, Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T), and Food &amp; Consumer Education
(FCE). This grading scheme will provide clearer feedback on students’ progress
and skills.</p>
<p>Under this new system, student performance will be assessed using a four-level
grading scale:</p>

<p><strong>How Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) benefits your child</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>More inclusive learning environment</strong>
<br>Students learn alongside peers from different academic backgrounds, building
empathy, respect, and understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exposure to diverse strengths</strong>
<br>Classroom discussions and group work allow students to appreciate how
classmates contribute in different ways, not just academically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning pathways that match individual strengths</strong>
<br>If your child excels in a subject, they can take it at a higher level,
allowing them to be challenged and supported appropriately. FSBB encourages
students to explore interests, discover what they are good at, and build
confidence in their abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Development of life skills</strong>
<br>Working with different peers helps students grow in e21cc skills in communication,
teamwork, and critical thinking — skills that matter in school and beyond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stronger preparation for post-secondary choices</strong>
<br>Whether your child is inclined toward Sciences, Humanities, Arts, or Applied
learning, FSBB opens up pathways that match their talents and long-term
goals in post-secondary education.</p>
