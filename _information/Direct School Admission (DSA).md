<p><strong>Direct School Admission (DSA-SEC) To 2025 Secondary 1</strong>
</p>
<p>The DSA-Sec aims to promote holistic education by allowing students to
seek admission to a secondary school on the basis of talents and achievements
that may not be demonstrated at the Primary School Leaving Examination
(PSLE). The DSA-Sec enables students to enter suitable academic and non-academic
programmes in Secondary Schools that can develop the students in these
areas.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent.</p>
<p>Damai Secondary School invites students who show talents and achievements
in the following areas to apply to our school via the DSA-Sec exercise:</p>
<p>a. Rugby (Boys)</p>
<p>b. Netball (Girls)</p>
<p>c. Canoeing (Girls)</p>
<p>d. Symphonic Band (Concert Band)</p>
<p>e. Choir</p>
<p>f. Girl Guides</p>
<p>g. National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC)</p>
