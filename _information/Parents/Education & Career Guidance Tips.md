<p>Parents play place a crucial role in ECG with their children as they:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Help your children discover their interest and strengths;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guide them to make informed education and career choices that will impact
their future significantly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help them to find relevance in the subjects they are studying and hence,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage them to be more motivated to work hard and do well in school</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents can help their children realise their dreams by:</p>
<p><strong><u>Showing concern and support</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It is important for your children to know how much you care about their
future and your willingness to support them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of steering them in a particular journey, you could listen to
them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Exploring</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Introduce a variety of occupations to your children and help them discover
more about the different occupations. A valuable resource is MySkillsFuture
portal,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/secondary" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">‘</a>
<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/secondary’</a>. Your child has a personal account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage your child to complete the self-assessment tools (Career Interests,
Skills Confidence, Work Values, Learning Styles) in the portal so as to
gain a better understanding of his/her interests, abilities and future
aspirations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cautionary note is not to rely on your own past experience or knowledge
as educational policies may have changed and new pathways are created.
It is important to stay updated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Engaging in Discussions</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Have casual conversations with your children about their aspirations.
Keep an open mind and allow them the freedom to dream. You could use your
child's results from the MySkillsFuture self-assessments and discuss further
educational plans. At the tertiary level, there are a myriad of educational
opportunities present. You can access our Higher Education webpage as a
starting point of discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Providing Opportunities</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Provide opportunities (such workplace visits and volunteer work) and resources
(such as books and enrichment programmes) that can support your children's
aspirations and broaden their horizons.</p>
<p><strong><u>Working with Schools</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Discuss your children's educational and career prospects with their teachers.
They would be in a good position to offer education and career guidance
as well. To help your child to make informed choices of their educational
and career pathways, do encourage your child to speak with our school ECG
Counsellor to explore and engage in self-discovery of their Values, Interests,
Personality and Strengths (V.I.P.S). Your child can book an appointment
with our ECG Counsellor through this link: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/dssecgcappointmentbooking</a>
<a href="https://go.gov.sg/dssecgcappointmentbooking" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Decision-making and Action-planning</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Ask your child what he/she wants to achieve and set some goals. Help your
child to come up with a plan on how he/she intends to attain these goals.
Review these goals periodically to keep your child motivated and on-track.
Make adjustments along the way, with a flexible mindset for Plan B.</p>
