<p>Our students' Personal Learning Devices (PLD) have been installed with
a Device Management Application (DMA) to ensure that they use the PLD for
learning in a safe digital environment.&nbsp;The following DMA settings
are in place as a default:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>MOE and the school will set the level of web content filtering, including
filtering out social media sites, pornography, gambling, extremist and
violence-related sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PLD usage time is set to 6:00am to 11:00pm daily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school determines the apps and programmes to be installed to support
teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A parent/guardian account allows parent/guardian to monitor his/her child/wardâ€™s
PLD activities and partner the school to ensure his/her cyber well-being.</p>
</li>
</ul>
