<p>Our students' Personal Learning Devices (PLD) have been installed with a Device Management Application (DMA) to ensure that they use the PLD for learning in a safe digital environment.&nbsp;The following DMA settings are in place as a default:</p>
<ul>
<li>MOE and the school will set the level of web content filtering, including filtering out social media sites, pornography, gambling, extremist and violence-related sites.</li>
<li>PLD usage time is set to 6:00am to 11:00pm daily.</li>
<li>The school determines the apps and programmes to be installed to support teaching and learning.</li>
<li>A parent/guardian account allows parent/guardian to monitor his/her child/ward&rsquo;s PLD activities and partner the school to ensure his/her cyber well-being.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to&nbsp;<a href="/files/DMA%20Annex%20A.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annex A</a>&nbsp;for more details on the functions and features of the DMA.</p>

<p>Please refer to&nbsp;<a href="/files/Information/Parents/DMA/DMA%20Annex%20C.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annex C</a>&nbsp;for more details on privacy and data security of the DMA.</p>


<p><strong>After-School DMA Options<br /></strong>For parents/guardians who prefer the default DMA setting,&nbsp;<strong>no action is required</strong>. The in-school DMA settings will continue to operate after school hours.</p>
<p>Parents/guardians who prefer alternative DMA settings can choose from the following options:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A</strong>: To modify DMA settings during the school-prescribed after-school hours.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Option B</strong>: To disable the DMA settings during the school-prescribed after-school hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to&nbsp;<a href="/files/DMA%20Annex%20B.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annex B</a>&nbsp;for details of these after-school options.</p>
