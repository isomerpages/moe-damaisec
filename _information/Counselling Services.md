<p><strong><u>What is School Counselling?</u></strong></p>
<p>Counselling is defined as a collaborative process in which the counsellor or psychologist facilitates the expansion of the student&rsquo;s view of life, enlarges his repertoire of coping resources and enables him to make choices for change in himself, the situation and the environment, without destructive consequences to self or others.</p>
<p>The counselling services in school are organised in a tiered system, beginning with first level intervention by teachers. If the intervention is unsuccessful or for cases requiring more specialised attention, referral is made by teachers to the Teacher Counsellors, Allied Educator (Counselling), Part Time School Counsellors, or external counsellors employed by the school. Students requiring more intense intervention are referred to MOE Guidance Specialists or professional agencies, such as the Child Guidance Clinic.</p>
<p><strong>School counselling sessions can:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide someone who will listen to your concerns with care, respect and confidentiality as when you need someone to talk to or to listen to you.</li>
<li>Give you opportunities to explore your feelings and thoughts, examine options, weigh alternatives and gain new perspectives of yourself, the situation and your environment for the situation you are facing.</li>
<li>Help you work on your self-acceptance, self-worth and confidence.</li>
<li>Help you to manage the challenges you face more effectively by enabling you to make choices for yourself and in yourself and the situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may take some time for the above to happen and we encourage you to continue with the counselling sessions as requested by the counsellors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The School Counselling Team</u></strong></p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s counselling team is made up of three key members: a Senior AED (Counselling) Ms Ilyana and Teacher Counsellor, Mdm Choo Lee Ming. The team also includes&nbsp;Ms Rajes,&nbsp;AED (Learning and Behavioural Support) who provide structured and systematic support to students with mild Special Educational Needs (SEN) in mainstream schools, and enable them to integrate better in the mainstream schools.&nbsp;</p>
