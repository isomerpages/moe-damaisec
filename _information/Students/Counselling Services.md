<p><strong><u>What is School Counselling?</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Counselling is defined as a collaborative process in which the counsellor
or psychologist facilitates the expansion of the student’s view of life,
enlarges his repertoire of coping resources and enables him to make choices
for change in himself, the situation and the environment, without destructive
consequences to self or others.</p>
<p>The counselling services in school are organised in a tiered system, beginning
with first level intervention by teachers. If the intervention is unsuccessful
or for cases requiring more specialised attention, referral is made by
teachers to the Teacher Counsellors, School Counsellors, Part Time School
Counsellors, or external counsellors employed by the school. Students requiring
more intense intervention are referred to MOE Guidance Specialists or professional
agencies, such as the Child Guidance Clinic.</p>
<p><strong>School counselling sessions can:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Provide someone who will listen to your concerns with care, respect and
confidentiality as when you need someone to talk to or to listen to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give you opportunities to explore your feelings and thoughts, examine
options, weigh alternatives and gain new perspectives of yourself, the
situation and your environment for the situation you are facing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help you work on your self-acceptance, self-worth and confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help you to manage the challenges you face more effectively by enabling
you to make choices for yourself and in yourself and the situation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It may take some time for the above to happen and we encourage you to
continue with the counselling sessions as requested by the counsellors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The School Counselling Team</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The school’s counselling team is made up of four key members: a Senior
School Counsellor Ms Ilyana and Teacher Counsellors, Mdm Choo Lee Ming
and Mdm Tan Boon Siew. The team also includes Senior SEN Officer Ms Rajes
, who provide structured and systematic support to students with mild Special
Educational Needs (SEN) in mainstream schools, and enable them to integrate
better in the mainstream schools.&nbsp;</p>
