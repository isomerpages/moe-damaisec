<p><strong>School Safety Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>To develop a safety culture for teaching and learning to take place</p>
<p><strong>School Safety Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>A safety culture to facilitate effective teaching and learning</p>
<p><strong>School Safety Motto</strong>
</p>
<p>In safety, every Damaian matters.</p>
<p>Safety is of utmost importance as we journey with our students on their
exploration to discover themselves, their interests and talents, and nurturing
them to always do their best.&nbsp; Safety is enhanced and risks are minimized
through the adoption of a&nbsp;<strong>SAFETY FRAMEWORK</strong>&nbsp;that
guides the school in building a culture of safety.</p>
<p>Both the mission and vision underpin high levels of safety consciousness
so that the core business of school education can be conducted in a safe
environment.&nbsp; The School Safety Motto emphasizes that safety begins
with self, and everyone must take ownership of own safety and others’ safety
in developing the safety culture.</p>
