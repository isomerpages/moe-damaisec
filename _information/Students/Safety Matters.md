**School Safety Mission**

To develop a safety culture for teaching and learning to take place

**School Safety Vision**

A safety culture to facilitate effective teaching and learning

**School Safety Motto**

In safety, every Damaian matters

Safety is of utmost importance as we journey with our students on their exploration to discover themselves, their interests and talents, and nurturing them to always do their best.  Safety is enhanced and risks are minimized through the adoption of a **SAFETY FRAMEWORK** that guides the school in building a culture of safety.

Both the mission and vision underpin high levels of safety consciousness so that the core business of school education can be conducted in a safe environment.  The School Safety Motto emphasizes that safety begins with self, and everyone must take ownership of own safety and others’ safety in developing the safety culture.
