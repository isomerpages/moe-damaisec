**PHILOSOPHY**  
Effective and meaningful assessments are essential elements that support students in acquiring the skills and competencies necessary to lead a purposeful and meaningful life. In Damai Secondary, we seek to provide quality student-centric academic programmes that will enable students to develop their potential and meet future challenges. Assessment provides students, teachers, parents and stakeholders with feedback that not only demonstrates understanding, but also affords opportunities for reflection that improves the inquiry and teaching and learning process. It must thus be ongoing, unbiased, and designed to meet the needs of our diverse learning community.&nbsp;  
  
**PRINCIPLES OF ASSESSMENT**&nbsp;

The Damai Assessment Policy is based on the Singapore Teaching Practice™, on the understanding that:

*   Assessment forms an integral part of Teaching and Learning&nbsp;  
    
*   Assessment must be aligned to the intended learning outcomes, content and pedagogy  
    
*   Assessment facilitates meaningful learning, is learner-centric and has a formative effect on our students’ learning  
    
*   The Assessment System should be balanced – integrating Assessment for Learning (AfL), Assessment of Learning (AoL) and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the school curriculum  
    
*   Assessment information should be collected regularly to inform and evaluate current school practices so as to enhance future teaching and learning practices  
    

  

**ASSESSMENT IN DAMAI**  

Termly Weighted Assessments (WA) are conducted regularly to gauge the learning progress of the students. These can be in the form of written tests, project work or other forms. WA in Damai primarily serve the formative purpose of gathering and interpret evidence about student learning for the purpose of determining where students are at in their learning, where they need to go and how best to get there.

  

An End-of-year Examination (EOY) will be conducted at the end of each academic year for Secondary 1, 2 and 3 students.&nbsp; For students who are taking National Examination (GCE ‘N’ and ‘O’ Level Examination) at the end of the year, the school will conduct a Preliminary Examination at the end of third term.

  

Performance at WA and EOY will determine students’ promotion, retention or lateral transfers to the next academic level, and allocation of subjects at the Secondary Two streaming exercise.

**GRADING FOR WEIGHTED ASSESSMENT**  

All Weighted Assessments (WA), regardless of form, will be administered by the subject teacher in class to evaluate, inform and improve student learning progress of the students. Marks from the WA will be recorded in the student’s Termly Progress Report.

  

Subject teachers will regularly record student scores in the various WA task/test in their respective department Results Analysis spreadsheet. A computed total of the various WA components for the term will be consolidated for input into School Cockpit, in order for it to be computed and printed in the student’s Termly Progress Report and/or Report Book.
