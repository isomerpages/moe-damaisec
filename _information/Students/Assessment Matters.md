<p><strong>PHILOSOPHY</strong>
<br>Effective and meaningful assessments are essential elements that support
students in acquiring the skills and competencies necessary to lead a purposeful
and meaningful life. In Damai Secondary, we seek to provide quality student-centric
academic programmes that will enable students to develop their potential
and meet future challenges. Assessment provides students, teachers, parents
and stakeholders with feedback that not only demonstrates understanding,
but also affords opportunities for reflection that improves the inquiry
and teaching and learning process. It must thus be ongoing, unbiased, and
designed to meet the needs of our diverse learning community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PRINCIPLES OF ASSESSMENT</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Damai Assessment Policy is based on the Singapore Teaching Practice™,
on the understanding that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assessment forms an integral part of Teaching and Learning&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment must be aligned to the intended learning outcomes, content
and pedagogy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment facilitates meaningful learning, is learner-centric and has
a formative effect on our students’ learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Assessment System should be balanced – integrating Assessment for
Learning (AfL), Assessment of Learning (AoL) and Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) in the school curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment information should be collected regularly to inform and evaluate
current school practices so as to enhance future teaching and learning
practices</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ASSESSMENT IN DAMAI</strong>
</p>
<p>Termly Weighted Assessments (WA) are conducted regularly to gauge the
learning progress of the students. These can be in the form of written
tests, project work or other forms. WA in Damai primarily serve the formative
purpose of gathering and interpret evidence about student learning for
the purpose of determining where students are at in their learning, where
they need to go and how best to get there.</p>
<p>An End-of-year Examination (EOY) will be conducted at the end of each
academic year for Secondary 1, 2 and 3 students.&nbsp; For students who
are taking National Examination (GCE ‘N’ and ‘O’ Level Examination) at
the end of the year, the school will conduct a Preliminary Examination
at the end of third term.</p>
<p>Performance at WA and EOY will determine students’ promotion, retention
or lateral transfers to the next academic level, and allocation of subjects
at the Secondary Two streaming exercise.</p>

in Damai.</p>
<p><strong>GRADING FOR WEIGHTED ASSESSMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>All Weighted Assessments (WA), regardless of form, will be administered
by the subject teacher in class to evaluate, inform and improve student
learning progress of the students. Marks from the WA will be recorded in
the student’s Termly Progress Report.</p>
<p>Subject teachers will regularly record student scores in the various WA
task/test in their respective department Results Analysis spreadsheet.
A computed total of the various WA components for the term will be consolidated
for input into School Cockpit, in order for it to be computed and printed
in the student’s Termly Progress Report and/or Report Book.</p>
