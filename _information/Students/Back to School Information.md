</p>
<p>Dear Damaians,</p>
<p>Welcome Back to School!</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming all of you! Get ready for an exciting new
school year.</p>
<p>As you step into the new academic year, the school looks forward to embarking
on this new phase of learning together and supporting their growth and
success.</p>
<p>To begin the year on a positive note, the school will be conducting the <strong>Start Right Programme</strong>.
You should report to the <strong>school hall by 7:25 a.m. on 2 January 2026</strong>,
in <strong>half-school uniform</strong>, and be <strong>properly groomed and attired</strong> (refer
to pages 8–11 of the Student Handbook). While you do not need not bring
textbooks on the first day, you should bring a school bag with your <strong>writing materials</strong> (a
pen and a small notebook) and a <strong>water bottle</strong>.</p>
<p>Incoming <strong>Secondary 1 students</strong> who have yet to purchase
the Damai Secondary School uniform may report in their <strong>primary school uniform</strong>.</p>
