<p>The emblem of the school crest is a blazing beacon, consisting of three digits of a hand (representing Bedok North Secondary School) and two letters, &lsquo;DS&rsquo; (representing Damai Secondary School). It symbolises the historical merger of the two schools in 2018.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>three digits</strong>&nbsp;also symbolise our school motto &ndash; Aspire, Explore and Achieve.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>beacon</strong>&nbsp;represents the school&rsquo;s commitment to serve as a guiding light to students and to brighten their paths by helping them to create a purposeful and meaningful life. This is achieved by leading students to acquire the right moral values, discover their interests and talents and to do their best.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>School Song</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By the edge of Reservoir<br />Damai Secondary standing tall<br />We may come from different homes,<br />As&nbsp;one, we will never walk alone&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Strive for excellence in all we do<br />With care, passion and staying true<br />Together we build our future,<br />With hope, passion and resolute&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Head, heart and hands we offer,<br />Let us build our Singapore<br />May our vision lead us towards<br />A life of meaning and purpose&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">May our vision lead us towards<br />A life of meaning and purpose&nbsp;</p>
